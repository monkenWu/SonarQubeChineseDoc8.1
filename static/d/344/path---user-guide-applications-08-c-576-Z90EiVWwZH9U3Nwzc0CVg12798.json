This is usually known within a development team as \"master\" or \"head\" and is analyzed when no specific branch parameters are provided. It is labeled \"Main Branch\" and defaults to the name \"master\" but can be renamed from the project settings at <strong>Administration > Branches and Pull Requests</strong>. When you are using Community Edition, this is the only branch you see.</p>\n<h3>Settings and Quality Profiles on Branches</h3>\n<p>Branch settings and quality profiles are the same as those set for the master branch, and by design, it's not possible to configure other values. The New Code Period is the only exception to this as it can be set on a branch-by-branch basis. </p>\n<h3>New Code Period</h3>\n<p>You can set a New Code Period for each branch. This is especially helpful if you are likely to develop and release multiple versions from the branch. See the <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/project-administration/new-code-period/\">New Code Period</a> documentation for more information on setting a New Code Period.</p>\n<h3>Quality Gate</h3>\n<p>The branch Quality Gate lets you know if your branch is ready to be merged. Each branch has a quality gate that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applies on conditions on New Code and overall code.</li>\n<li>Assigns a status (Passed or Failed).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting up Branch analysis</h2>\n<p>A branch is created when the <code>sonar.branch.name</code> parameter is passed during analysis.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter Name</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.branch.name</code></td>\n<td>Name of the branch (visible in the UI)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Limiting analysis to relevant branches</h3>\n<p>You need to add a condition to your pipeline script to ensure only relevant branches are analyzed. For example, you wouldn't want to run analysis on feature branches that won't need analysis until they have pull requests . </p>\n<p>In the following example, analysis would be limited to branches named <code>master</code> or <code>release/*</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>if [[ \"$CI_BRANCH_NAME\" == master ]] || [[ \"$CI_BRANCH_NAME\" == release/* ]]; then\n  ./gradlew sonarqube\nfi\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Issue Creation and Synchronization</h3>\n<p>During the first analysis, issues (type, severity, status, assignee, change log, comments) are synchronized with the Main Branch. In each synchronized issue, a comment is added to the change log of the issue on the branch: \"The issue has been copied from branch 'master' to branch yyy\".</p>\n<p>At each subsequent analysis of the branch, any new issue that comes from a pull request automatically inherits the attributes (type, severity, ...) the issue had in the pull request. A comment is added to the change log of the issue on the branch: \"The issue has been merged from 'xxx' into 'yyy'\"</p>\n<h3>Fetching full Git history</h3>\n<p>By default, some CIs don't fetch your full Git history. For example, TravisCI only fetches the last 50 git commits. You must use <code>git fetch --unshallow</code> to get the full history. If you don't, new issues may not be assigned to the correct developer.</p>\n<h2>Managing inactive branches</h2>\n<p>Inactive branches are branches that are no longer being analyzed. You can use Housekeeping to automatically delete branches that are inactive (i.e. old feature branches) or to keep inactive branches that you want to continue maintaining (i.e. release branches). </p>\n<h3>Deleting inactive branches</h3>\n<p>You can set the number of days a branch can be inactive before it's deleted in the global settings at <strong>Administration > General Settings > Housekeeping > Number of days before deleting inactive branches</strong>. Branches that are inactive for the number of days that you set will be automatically deleted.</p>\n<h3>Using patterns to keep inactive branches</h3>\n<p>You can use naming patterns to protect specific branches, such as release branches, from automatic deletion. To do this, add a pattern using Java regular expressions under <strong>Administration > General Settings > Housekeeping > Branches > Branches to keep when inactive</strong> at either the global or project level. When a branch is created with a name that follows one of these patterns, it will be kept indefinitely. </p>\n<p>For example, adding the pattern <code>release/.*</code> would keep any branches named release/6.0, release/7, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Patterns aren't retroactive and won't apply to branches that have already been created. They only apply to branches created after the pattern is set. You can protect an existing branch at the project level. See the following section.</p>\n<h3>Managing inactive branches at a project level</h3>\n<p>You can set a branch to <strong>Keep when inactive</strong> at the project level from from the <strong>Branches</strong> tab at <strong>Administration > Branches and Pull Requests</strong>. Here, you can also turn off protection for a branch so it will be deleted when it's inactive for the number of days that has been specified in the global settings at <strong>Administration > General Settings > Housekeeping > Number of days before deleting inactive branches</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The main branch is always protected from automatic deletion, even if it's inactive. This can't be changed.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/branches/overview/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><em>Branch analysis is available as part of <a href=\"https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/developer.html\">Developer Edition</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sonarsource.com/plans-and-pricing/\">above</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>How long are branches retained?</h2>\n<p>Branches will be deleted automatically when they are inactive according to your settings at <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings?category=housekeeping\">Administration > Configuration > General Settings > Housekeeping > Number of days before deleting inactive branches</a> except for branches you have set to be kept when inactive.

The outcome of this analysis will be quality measures and issues (instances where coding rules were broken). However, what gets analyzed will vary depending on the language:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On all languages, \"blame\" data will automatically be imported from supported SCM providers. <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/scm-integration/\">Git and SVN are supported automatically</a>. Other providers require additional plugins.</li>\n<li>On all languages, a static analysis of source code is performed (Java files, COBOL programs, etc.)</li>\n<li>A static analysis of compiled code can be performed for certain languages (.class files in Java, .dll files in C#, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Will all files be analyzed?</h2>\n<p>By default, only files that are recognized by a language analyzer are loaded into the project during analysis.\nFor example if your SonarQube instance had only SonarJava SonarJS on board, all .java and .js files would be loaded, but .xml files would be ignored.</p>\n<h2>What about branches and pull requests?</h2>\n<p><em>Developer Edition</em> adds the ability to analyze your project's <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/branches/overview/\">branches</a> and <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/pull-request/\">pull requests</a> as well as the ability to automatically decorate pull requests in some ALM interfaces. </p>\n<h2>What happens during analysis?</h2>\n<p>During analysis, data is requested from the server, the files provided to the analysis are analyzed, and the resulting data is sent back to the server at the end in the form of a report, which is then analyzed asynchronously server-side.</p>\n<p>Analysis reports are queued, and processed sequentially, so it is quite possible that for a brief period after your analysis log shows completion, the updated values are not visible in your SonarQube project. However, you will be able to tell what's going on because an icon will be added on the project homepage to the right of the project name. Mouse over it for more detail (and links if you're logged in with the proper permissions).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/backgroundTaskProcessingInProgress.jpeg\" alt=\"background task processing in progress.\"></p>\n<p>The icon goes away once processing is complete, but if analysis report processing fails for some reason, the icon changes:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/backgroundTaskProcessingFailedIcon.jpeg\" alt=\"background task processing failed.\"></p>\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong> Analysis errors out with <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded</code>. What do I do?<br>\n<strong>A.</strong> This means your project is too large or too intricate for the scanner to analyze with the default memory allocation. To fix this you'll want to allocate a larger heap (using <code>-Xmx[numeric value here]</code>) to the process running the analysis. Some CI engines may give you an input to specify the necessary values, for instance if you're using a Maven Build Step in a Jenkins job to run analysis.

It detects when data that's potentially manipulated by a malicious user reaches a sensitive piece of code where an attack can occur.</p>\n<p>Those potentially malicious data are also called <strong>tainted data</strong>, because they are tainted by user inputs. </p>\n<p>SonarQube's security engine already knows a lot of APIs that are potential sources of attack and APIs that are potential targets of attack. While we do our best to identify publicly available APIs, we can't know everything about your homemade frameworks particularly when it comes to sanitizing your data. Because of this, SonarQube allows you to customize the security engine to add your own \"sources\", \"sanitizers\", \"passthroughs\", and \"sinks\" (see the <strong>Elements</strong> section below for more on these elements).</p>\n<p>For example, you may want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add a source to add support for a framework that SonarQube doesn't cover out of the box</li>\n<li>use a custom sanitizer to tell to the security engine that all data going through sanitizers should be considered as safe. This allows you to remove false positives and tailor the security engine to your company.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Elements</h2>\n<p>You can add the following elements to your custom configuration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Source</strong> – Where you get user data. You should always consider user data tainted and vulnerable to injection attacks.\nExample: Calling <code>HttpServletRequest#getParam(\"foo\")</code> will return tainted content</li>\n<li><strong>Sanitizer</strong> – Finds and removes malicious content from tainted data.</li>\n<li><strong>Passthrough</strong> – Allows you to keep track of tainted data sent to a library outside of the current function. When you pass a tainted value to a library functions outside of the current function, SonarQube automatically assumes it's being passed to a sanitizer. If the tainted data isn't being passed to a sanitizer, you can set up a passthrough to keep track of the data.</li>\n<li><strong>Sink</strong> – A piece of code that can perform a security sensitive task. Data should not contain any malicious content once it reaches a sink.\nExample: Running an SQL query with <code>java.sql.Statement#execute</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Analysis Parameters</h2>\n<p>To customize the SonarQube security engine, you need to feed security configuration data through parameters given to the SonarScanners.

Index starts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>1</code> for a fonction call. </li>\n<li><code>0</code> for a method call, index <code>0</code> beeing the current instance (<code>this</code>) </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>MethodId</h2>\n<p>All the custom configurations rely on the accuracy of the <code>methodIds</code> provided. For each language, the format of the <code>methodId</code> is different.</p>\n<h3>MethodId for Java</h3>\n<p>The <code>methodId</code> format is inspired by the bytecode. The easiest way to get a <code>methodId</code> is to write a simple piece of Java code, compile it and then look at the bytecode generated using the <code>javap -c path_to.class</code> file, and transform it a little. Looking at the following real-life example will help you understand the format.</p>\n<p>Let's imagine you want to declare <code>org.rapidoid.jdbc.JdbcClient.execute(String sql, Object... args)</code> as a new sink (you don't need to do this because Rapidoid is part of what is covered out of the box).</p>\n<p>Write a simple piece of code calling the JdbcClient.execute(...) method. The code doesn't need to actually do anything.</p>\n<pre><code>import org.rapidoid.http.Req;\nimport org.rapidoid.jdbc.JdbcClient;\n\npublic static void callJDBCMethods(Req req) {\n  String tainted = req.param(\"TAINTED\");\n  JdbcClient jdbc = JDBC.api();\n  dbc.execute(tainted, req); // Noncompliant\n}      \n</code></pre>\n<p>Run the <code>javap -c</code> and locate the piece of bytecode corresponding to the call to <code>JdbcClient.execute</code></p>\n<pre><code>[...]\norg/rapidoid/jdbc/JdbcClient.execute:(Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/Object;)I\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace the <code>/</code> in the package name with  <code>.</code></li>\n<li>Remove the <code>:</code></li>\n<li>Replace the <code>.</code> separating the Class name and the Method name with a <code>#</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The resulting <code>methodId</code> is:</p>\n<pre><code>org.rapidoid.jdbc.JdbcClient#execute(Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/Object;)I\n</code></pre>\n<h3>MethodId for PHP</h3>\n<p>The <code>methodId</code> can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the name of a PHP function </li>\n<li>the fully qualified name of a method following this format: <code>namespace\\\\ClassName::methodName</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: <code>Symfony\\\\Component\\\\HttpFoundation\\\\Request::getUser</code> for the <code>getUser()</code> method of the <code>Request</code> object provided by <code>Symfony</code></p>\n<p>Note: the <code>methodId</code> should be related to methods or functions that are part of the analysis scope. Because we recommended to not analyze code of frameworks at the same time that you scan your own source code, defining methods or functions from frameworks will have no effect.\nThis is linked to the fact that the SonarQube security engine needs to know the runtime type of each variable. The type can't be guessed when objects are created by frameworks' factories. Out of the box, the SonarQube security engine supports the main Symfony and Laravel types.</p>\n<h3>MethodId for C#</h3>\n<p>If you want to declare the constructor <code>SqlCommand</code> belonging to the namespace <code>System.Data.SqlClient</code> as a sink, the <code>methodId</code> should be:</p>\n<pre><code>System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.SqlCommand(string, System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection)\n</code></pre>\n<p>You simply need to provide the fully qualified name of the method or constructor plus the types of the arguments.</p>\n<h2>Deactivate Core Configuration</h2>\n<p>You can disable the core configuration per language or per rule using the following:</p>\n<pre><code>sonar.security.[ConfigType].[RuleRepository].noDefaultConfig=[true|false]\nsonar.security.[ConfigType].[RuleRepository].[RuleKey].noDefaultConfig=[true|false]\n</code></pre>","fields":{"slug":"/analysis/security_configuration/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>There are two ways to extend coding rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing coding rules using Java via a SonarQube plugin</li>\n<li>Adding XPath rules directly through the SonarQube web interface</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If both are available, the Java API will be more fully-featured than what's available for XPath, and is generally preferable.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block alert alert-info\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>Before implementing a new coding rule, you should consider whether it is specific to your own context or might benefit others.

Knowing the XPath language is the only prerequisite, and there are a lot of tutorials on XPath online.</p>\n<p>The latest version of SSLR Toolkit can be downloaded from following locations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonar-flex-plugin/\">Flex</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://binaries.sonarsource.com/CommercialDistribution/sslr-plsql-toolkit/\">PL/SQL</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://binaries.sonarsource.com/CommercialDistribution/sslr-pli-toolkit/\">PL/I</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For an SSLR preview, consider the following source code sample:</p>\n<pre><code>function HelloWorld(hour) {\n  if (hour) {\n    this.hour = hour;\n  } else {\n    var date = new Date();\n    this.hour = date.getHours();\n  }\n  this.displayGreeting = function() {\n    if (this.hour >= 22 || this.hour &#x3C;= 5)\n      document.write(\"Good night, World!\");\n    else\n      document.write(\"Hello, World!\");\n  } \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>While parsing source code, SonarQube builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for it, and the SSLR Toolkit provided for each language will show you SonarQube's AST for a given piece of code. Here's the AST for our sample:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/astSample.png\" alt=\"AST example\"></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath\">XPath</a> language provides a way to write coding rules by navigating this AST, and the SSLR Toolkit for the language will give you the ability to test your new rules against your sample code.</p>\n<h3>Adding your Rule to the Server</h3>\n<p>Once your new rule is written, you can add it SonarQube:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Login as an Quality Profile Administrator</li>\n<li>Go to Rules page</li>\n<li>Select the Language for which you want to create the XPath rule</li>\n<li>Tick the Template criterion and select \"Show Templates Only\" </li>\n<li>Look for the XPath rule template</li>\n<li>Click on it to select it, then use the interface controls to create a new instance</li>\n<li>Fill in the form that pops up</li>\n<li>Once you've created your rule, you'll need to add it to a Quality Profile and run analysis to see it in action.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Coding rule guidelines</h2>\n<p>These are the guidelines that SonarSource uses internally to specify new rules. Rules in community plugins are not required to adhere to these guidelines. They are provided here only in case they are useful.</p>\n<p>Note that fields \"title\", \"description\" and \"message\" have a different format when the rule type is \"Hotspot\".</p>\n<h3>Guidelines for Bug, Vulnerability, and Code Smell rules</h3>\n<h4>Titles</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The title of the rule should match the pattern \"X should [ not ] Y\" for most rules. Note that the \"should [ not ]\" pattern is too strong for Finding rules, which are about observations on the code. Finding titles should be neutral, such as \"Track x\".</li>\n<li>\n<p>All other things being equal, the positive form is preferred. E.G.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"X should Y\" is preferred to </li>\n<li>\"X should not Z\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Titles should be written in plural form if at all possible. E.G.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"/images/check.svg\">Flibbers should gibbet</li>\n<li><img src=\"/images/cross.svg\">A Flibber should gibbet</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Any piece of code in the rule title should be double-quoted (and not single-quoted).</li>\n<li>There should be no category/tag prefixed to the rule title, such as \"Accessibility - Image tags should have an alternate text attribute\"</li>\n<li>Titles should be as concise as possible. Somewhere around 70 or 80 characters is an ideal maximum, although this is not always achievable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Noncompliant Title Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>File should not have too many lines of code  // Noncompliant; singular form used</li>\n<li>Avoid file with too many lines of code  // Noncompliant; doesn't follow \"x should [not] y\" pattern</li>\n<li>Too many lines of code  // Noncompliant</li>\n<li>Don't use \"System.(out/err)\"  // Noncompliant</li>\n<li>Parameters in an overriding virtual function should either use the same default arguments as the function they override, or not specify any default arguments  // Noncompliant; waaaay too long</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compliant Solutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Files should not have too many lines of code  </li>\n<li>\"System.(out/err)\" should not be used to log messages</li>\n<li>Overriding virtual functions should not change parameter defaults</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Starting with the subject, such as \"Files\", will ensure that all rules applying to files will be grouped together.</p>\n<h4>Descriptions</h4>\n<p>Rule descriptions should contain the following sections in the listed order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rationale</strong> (unlabeled) - explaining why this rule make sense.\nIf it's not absolutely clear from the rationale what circumstances will cause an issue to be raised, then this section should end with \"This rule raises an issue when [ insert circumstances here ]\".</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Noncompliant Code Example</strong> - providing some examples of issues</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ideally, the examples should depend upon the default values of any parameters the rule has, and these default values should be mentioned before the code block. This is for the benefit of users whose rule parameters are tuned to something other than the default values. E.G.\nWith a parameter of: <code><em>:.</em>log4j.*</code></li>\n<li>The lines in these code samples where issues are expected should be marked with a \"Noncompliant\" comment</li>\n<li>\"Compliant\" comments may be used to help demonstrate the difference between what is and is not allowed by the rule</li>\n<li>It is acceptable to omit this section when demonstrating noncompliance would take too long, e.g. \"Classes should not have too many lines of code\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Compliant Solution</strong> - demonstrating how to fix the previous issues. Good to have but not required for rules that detect bugs. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no need to mark anything \"Compliant\" in the Compliant Solution; everything here is compliant by definition</li>\n<li>It is acceptable to omit this section when there are too many equally viable solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Exceptions</strong> (optional) - listing and explaining some specific use cases where no issues are logged even though some might be expected. Note that this is sometimes incorporated into the rationale, instead.</li>\n<li><strong>See</strong> (optional) - listing references and/or links to external standards like MISRA, SEI, CERT, &#x26;etc.\nDeprecated (optional): listing replacement rules with links</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Code samples for COBOL should be in upper case. </p>\n<p>When displayed in SonarQube, any code or keywords in the description should be enclosed in <code> tags. For descriptions written in JIRA, this means using double curly braces (<code>{{</code> and <code>}}</code>) to enclose such text. They will be translated in the final output.</p>\n<h4>Messages</h4>\n<p>Issue messages should contain the remediation message for bug and quality rules. For potential-bug rules, it should make it explicit that a manual review is required. It should be in the imperative mood (\"Do x\"), and therefore start with a verb.</p>\n<p>An issue message should always end with a period ('.') since it is an actual sentence, unless it ends with a regular expression, in which case the regular expression should be preceded by a colon and should end the message.</p>\n<p>Any piece of code in the the rule message should be double-quoted (and not single-quoted). Moreover, if an issue is triggered because a number was above a threshold value, then both the number and the threshold value should be mentioned in the issue message. </p>\n<p>Sample messages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove or refactor this useless \"switch\" statement. // Compliant</li>\n<li>This \"switch\" statement is useless and should be refactored or removed. // Noncompliant</li>\n<li>Every \"switch\" statement shall have at least one case-clause. // Noncompliant</li>\n<li>Rename this variable to comply with the regular expression: [a-z]+  // Compliant</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"custom-block collapse\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><h2>Sample Specification</h2><h3>Generic exceptions should not be thrown</h3><p>Using generic exceptions such as <code>Error</code>, <code>RuntimeException</code>, <code>Throwable</code>, and <code>Exception</code> prevents calling methods from handling true, system-generated exceptions differently than application-generated errors.</p><p><strong>Noncompliant Code Example</strong>  </p><pre><code>With the default regular expression [a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]+:\n\ntry { /* ... */ } catch (Exception e) { LOGGER.info(\"context\"); } // Noncompliant; exception is lost\ntry { /* ... */ } catch (Exception e) { LOGGER.info(e); } // Noncompliant; context is required\ntry { /* ... */ } catch (Exception e) { LOGGER.info(e.getMessage()); } // Noncompliant; exception is lost (only message is preserved)\ntry {\n/* ... */\n} catch (Exception e) { // Noncompliant - exception is lost\nthrow new RuntimeException(\"context\");\n}\n</code></pre><p><strong>Compliant Solution</strong>  </p><pre><code>try { /* ... */ } catch (Exception e) { LOGGER.info(\"context\", e); }\ntry {\n/* ... */\n} catch (Exception e) {\nthrow new RuntimeException(\"context\", e);\n}\n</code></pre><p><strong>Exceptions</strong><br>\nGeneric exceptions in the signatures of overriding methods are ignored.</p><pre><code>@Override\npublic void myMethod() throws Exception {...}\n</code></pre><p><strong>See</strong>  </p><ul>\n<li>MISRA C:2004, 4.5.2</li>\n<li>MITRE, <a href=\"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/580.html\">CWE-580</a> - clone() Method Without super.clone()</li>\n</ul><p><strong>See also</strong><br>\nS4567 - Rule title here</p></div></div>\n<h3>Guidelines for Hotspot rules</h3>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-4721\">RSPEC-4721</a> for an example of Hotspot rule.</p>\n<h4>Titles</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The title should start with a verb in the present participle form (-ing)</li>\n<li>The title should end with \"is security-sensitive\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Noncompliant Title Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid executing OS commands</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compliant Solution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Executing OS commands is security-sensitive</li>\n<li>Deserializing objects from an untrusted source is security-sensitive</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Descriptions</h4>\n<p>Rule descriptions should contain the following sections in the listed order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rationale</strong> (unlabeled) - explaining why this rule make sense.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It starts with a copy of the title.

For example: putting a password in an insecure cookie.</li>\n<li><strong>Sensitive Code Example</strong> - use this instead of \"Noncompilant code example\" when the Hotspot highlights some code which is not dangerous but might be the source of some vulnerability. Example: an opening Socket.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>See</strong> (optional) -  same as for Bug, Vulnerability and Code Smell rules.</li>\n<li><strong>Deprecated</strong> (optional) -  listing replacement rules with links.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guidelines regarding COBOL, keywords and code are the same as for other rules.</p>\n<h4>Messages</h4>\n<p>Most of the time you can paraphrase the title:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>start the sentence with \"Make sure that\"</li>\n<li>replace \"is security-sensitive\" with \"is safe here\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However for some rules it can make sense to change the title. See the examples below: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Title: Executing OS commands is security-sensitive</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Message: make sure that executing this OS command is safe here.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Title: Delivering code in production with debug mode activated is security-sensitive</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Message: Make sure this debug mode is deactivated before delivering the code in production.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Guidelines applicable to all rules</h3>\n<h4>See/References</h4>\n<p>When a reference is made to a standards specification, e.g. MISRA, the following steps must also be taken:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add any related tags, such as: security, bug, &#x26;etc.</li>\n<li>add the relevant standard-related tag/label such as cwe, misra, etc. (If you forget, the overnight automation will remember for you.) </li>\n<li>update the appropriate field on the References tab with the cited id. (If you forget, the overnight automation will remember for you.) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If needed, references to other rules should be listed under a \"See also\" heading. If a \"See\" heading exists in the rule, then the \"See also\" title should be at the h3 level. Otherwise, use an h2 for it.</p>\n<p>Other rules should be linked to only if they are related or contradictory (such as a pair of rules about where <code>{</code> should go).</p>\n<p>Why list references to other rules under \"see also\" instead of \"see\"? The see section is used to support the current rule, and one rule cannot be used as justification for another rule. </p>\n<h4>Rule Type</h4>\n<p>Now that you've fleshed out the description, you should have a fairly clear idea of what type of rule this is, but to be explicit:</p>\n<p><strong>Bug</strong> - Something that's wrong or potentially wrong. </p>\n<p><strong>Code Smell</strong> - Something that will confuse a maintainer or cause her to stumble in her reading of the code.</p>\n<p><strong>Vulnerability</strong> - Something that has a high chance of being exploited by an attacker.</p>\n<p><strong>HotSpot</strong> - Something that could result in a vulnerability depending on the context in which this code is present. </p>\n<p>Sometimes the line between Bug and Code Smell is fuzzy. When in doubt, ask yourself: \"Is code that breaks this rule doing what the programmer probably intended?\" If the answer is \"probably not\" then it's a Bug. Everything else is a Code Smell.</p>\n<h4>Default severities</h4>\n<p>When assessing the default severity of a rule, the first thing to do is ask yourself \"what's the worst thing that could happen?\" In answering, you should factor in Murphy's Law without predicting Armageddon.</p>\n<p>Once you have your answer, it's time to assess whether the Impact and Likelihood of the Worst Thing are High or Low. To do that, ask yourself these specific questions:</p>\n<p>Vulnerability</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impact: Could the exploitation of the vulnerability result in significant damage to your assets or your users? (Yes = High)</li>\n<li>Likelihood: What is the probability a hacker will be able to exploit the issue?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bug</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impact: Could the bug cause the application to crash or corrupt stored data?\n(Languages where an error can cause program termination: COBOL, Python, PL/SQL, RPG.) </li>\n<li>Likelihood: What is the probability the worst will happen?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Code Smell</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impact: Could the Code Smell lead a maintainer to introduce a bug?</li>\n<li>Likelihood: What is the probability the worst will happen?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have your Impact and Likelihood assessments, the rest is easy:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th> </th>\n<th>impact</th>\n<th>likelihood</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Blocker</td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/check.svg\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/check.svg\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Critical</td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/check.svg\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/cross.svg\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Major</td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/cross.svg\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/check.svg\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minor</td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/cross.svg\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/cross.svg\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Tags</h4>\n<p>Rules can have 0-n tags, although most rules should have at least one. Many of the common-across-languages tags are described in <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/user-guide/issues/\">the issues docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Evaluation of the remediation cost</h4>\n<p>For most rules, the SQALE remediation cost is constant per issue. The goal of this section is to help defining the value of this constant and to unify the way those estimations are done to prevent having some big discrepancies among language plugins. </p>\n<p>First step, classify the effort to do the remediation :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>TRIVIAL\nNo need to understand the logic and no potential impact.\nExamples: remove unused imports, replace tabulations by spaces, remove call to System.out.println() used for debugging purpose, ...</li>\n<li>EASY\nNo need to understand the logic but potential impacts.\nExamples: rename a method, rename a parameter, remove unused private method, ...</li>\n<li>MEDIUM\nUnderstanding the logic of a piece of code is required before doing a little and easy refactoring (1 or 2 lines of code). But understanding the big picture is not required.\nExamples : CURSORs should not be declared inside a loop, EXAMINE statement should not be used, IF should be closed with END-IF, ...</li>\n<li>MAJOR\nUnderstanding the logic of a piece of code is required and it's up to the developer to define the remediation action.\nExamples: Too many nested IF statements, Methods should not have too many parameters, UNION should not be used in SQL SELECT statements, Public java method should have a javadoc, Avoid using deprecated methods, ...</li>\n<li>HIGH\nThe remediation action might lead to locally impact the design of the application.\nExamples: Classes should not have too many responsibilities, Cobol programs should not have too many lines of code, Architectural constraint, ...</li>\n<li>COMPLEX\nThe remediation action might lead to impact the overall design of the application.\nExamples: Avoid cycles between packages, ...</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then use the following table to get the remediation cost according to the required remediation effort and to the language:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th> </th>\n<th>Trivial</th>\n<th>Easy</th>\n<th>Medium</th>\n<th>Major</th>\n<th>High</th>\n<th>Complex</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ABAP, COBOL, ...</td>\n<td>10min</td>\n<td>20min</td>\n<td>30min</td>\n<td>1h</td>\n<td>3h</td>\n<td>1d</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other languages</td>\n<td>5min</td>\n<td>10min</td>\n<td>20min</td>\n<td>1h</td>\n<td>3h</td>\n<td>1d</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For rules using either the \"linear\" or \"linear with offset\" remediation functions, the \"Effort To Fix\" field must be fed on each issue and this field is used to compute the remediation cost.  </p>\n<h4>Issue location(s) and highlighting</h4>\n<p>For any given rule, highlighting behavior should be consistent across languages within the bounds of what's relevant for each language.</p>\n<p>When possible, each issue should be raised on the line of code that needs correction, with highlighting limited to the portion of the line to be corrected. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an issue for a misnamed method should be raised on the line with the method name, and the method name itself should be highlighted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When correcting an issue requires action across multiple lines, the issue should be raised on the the lowest block that encloses all relevant lines. For example an issue for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>method complexity should be raised on the method signature</li>\n<li>method count in a class should be raised on the class declaration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When an issue could be made clearer by highlighting multiple code segments, such as a method complexity issue, additional issue locations may be highlighted, and additional messages may optionally be logged for those locations. In general, these guidelines should be followed for secondary issue locations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>highlight the minimum code to show the line's contribution to the issue. </li>\n<li>avoid using an additional message if the secondary location is likely to be on the same issue as the issue itself. For example: the rule \"Parameters should be final\" will raise an issue on the method name, and highlight each non-final parameter. Since all locations are likely to be on the same line, additional messages would only confuse the issue.</li>\n<li>don't write a novel. The message for a secondary location is meant to be a hint to push the user in the right direction. Don't take over the interface with a narrative.</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/extend/adding-coding-rules/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Please be aware that we are not actively looking for feature contributions to SonarQube itself because it's extremely difficult for someone outside SonarSource to comply with our roadmap and expectations.

If you do, please close the thread before final release with a \"feedback period closed\" notice.</p>\n<h2>Plugin deprecation</h2>\n<p>Occasionally, there's a need to deprecate a plugin. Typically for one or more of the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the functionality is obsolete or relies on deprecated platform functionality.</li>\n<li>It's no longer maintained by its authors and is buggy.</li>\n<li>It's no longer compatible with supported versions of the SonarQube platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In such case, the plugin is removed from the Marketplace.</p>\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong> What should the release candidate announcement look like?<br>\nThis is up to you, but ideally, it will contain a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>link to download the RC</li>\n<li>link to the version change log </li>\n<li>deadline for feedback</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, you should probably mention the contributors to the version if you didn't handle it solo.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong> How long should the feedback period be?<br>\nAgain, that's up to you; it's your plugin. At SonarSource, when we put out a Release Candidate (we don't always &#x26; its optional for you too), we use a minimum 72 hour feedback period (with variations for holidays, weekends, and significant feedback).</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  Who can give feedback?<br>\nAnyone! In fact, the more feedback the better. That's what makes developing in a community so wonderful. We just ask that when you have feedback, you keep it polite and respectful.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  What if I don't get any feedback on my release candidate?<br>\nYou have two choices: agitate for more attention or consider no news to be good news and proceed with your release.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  What if I get feedback that should block the release?<br>\nThe normal course of action here is to address the feedback and put out another release candidate. Typically, you would extend the feedback period to give people time to test the new version.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  What happens when the feedback period is over?<br>\nIf you didn't get any feedback that you feel should block the release, then send a \"period closed\" notification on the same thread, perform the release, and in a separate thread ask that the new version be added to the Marketplace.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  Should the initial release of a plugin be handled any differently than subsequent releases?<br>\nNot necessarily, although it's probably more critical to get feedback on an initial release. So if there's no response within the initial feedback period, you should probably agitate for more attention, instead of assuming that no news is good news. It's up to you, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  Who performs the release process?<br>\nYou do.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  Where should the jars be posted for download?<br>\nUp to you. If you're using GitHub to host your source code, then the easiest thing to do is create a project release and post downloads there.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  What should the release notes look like?<br>\nIn the best case, it will be a publicly accessible list of work tickets handled in the version, similar to what you can get from Jira or GitHub Issues. At minimum, it will be an outline of the work done. In either case, it must reflect all significant changes.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/extend/deploying-to-marketplace/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h2>Building your plugin</h2>\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>To build a plugin, you need Java 8 and Maven 3.1 (or greater).

The exhaustive list of extension points is available in the javadoc.</p>\n<p>The implementations of extension points (named \"extensions\") provided by a plugin must be declared in its entry point class, which implements org.sonar.api.Plugin and which is referenced in pom.xml:</p>\n<p>ExamplePlugin.java</p>\n<pre><code>package org.sonarqube.plugins.example;\nimport org.sonar.api.Plugin;\n \npublic class ExamplePlugin implements Plugin {\n  @Override\n  public void define(Context context) {\n    // implementations of extension points\n    context.addExtensions(FooLanguage.class, ExampleProperties.class);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>pom.xml</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n&#x3C;project>\n  ...\n  &#x3C;build>\n    &#x3C;plugins>\n      &#x3C;plugin>\n        &#x3C;groupId>org.sonarsource.sonar-packaging-maven-plugin&#x3C;/groupId>\n        &#x3C;artifactId>sonar-packaging-maven-plugin&#x3C;/artifactId>\n        &#x3C;extensions>true&#x3C;/extensions>\n        &#x3C;configuration>\n          &#x3C;pluginClass>org.sonarqube.plugins.example.ExamplePlugin&#x3C;/pluginClass>\n        &#x3C;/configuration>\n      &#x3C;/plugin>\n    &#x3C;/plugins>\n  &#x3C;/build>\n&#x3C;/project>\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Lifecycle</h3>\n<p>A plugin extension exists only in its associated technical stacks. A scanner sensor is for example instantiated and executed only in a scanner runtime, but not in the web server nor in Compute Engine. The stack is defined by the annotations <a href=\"http://javadocs.sonarsource.org/latest/apidocs/org/sonar/api/batch/ScannerSide.html\">@ScannerSide</a>, <a href=\"http://javadocs.sonarsource.org/latest/apidocs/index.html?org/sonar/api/server/ServerSide.html\">@ServerSide</a> (for web server) and <a href=\"http://javadocs.sonarsource.org/latest/apidocs/index.html?org/sonar/api/ce/ComputeEngineSide.html\">@ComputeEngineSide</a>. </p>\n<p>An extension can call core components or another extension of the same stack. These dependencies are defined by constructor injection:</p>\n<pre><code>@ScannerSide\npublic class Foo {\n  public void call() {}\n}\n \n// Sensor is a scanner extension point \npublic class MySensor implements Sensor {\n  private final Foo foo;\n  private final Languages languages;\n  \n  // Languages is core component which lists all the supported programming languages.\n  public MySensor(Foo foo, Languages languages) {   \n    this.foo = foo;\n    this.languages = languages;\n  }\n  \n  @Override\n  public void execute(SensorContext context) {\n    System.out.println(this.languages.all());\n    foo.call();\n  }\n}\n \n  \npublic class ExamplePlugin implements Plugin {\n  @Override\n  public void define(Context context) {\n    // Languages is a core component. It must not be declared by plugins.\n    context.addExtensions(Foo.class, MySensor.class);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is recommended not to call other components in constructors. Indeed, they may not be initialized at that time. Constructors should only be used for dependency injection.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block alert alert-warning\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>Compilation does not fail if incorrect dependencies are defined, such as a scanner extension trying to call a web server extension. Still it will fail at runtime when plugin is loaded.</p></div></div>\n<h3>Third-party Libraries</h3>\n<p>Plugins are executed in their own isolated classloaders. That allows the packaging and use of 3rd-party libraries without runtime conflicts with core internal libraries or other plugins. Note that since version 5.2, the SonarQube API does not bring transitive dependencies, except SLF4J. The libraries just have to be declared in the pom.xml with default scope \"compile\":</p>\n<p>pom.xml</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n&#x3C;project>\n  ...\n  &#x3C;dependencies>\n    ...\n    &#x3C;dependency>\n      &#x3C;groupId>commons-codec&#x3C;/groupId>\n      &#x3C;artifactId>commons-codec&#x3C;/artifactId>\n      &#x3C;version>1.10&#x3C;/version>\n    &#x3C;/dependency>\n &#x3C;/dependencies>\n&#x3C;/project>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Technically the libraries are packaged in the directory META-INF/lib of the generated JAR file. An alternative is to shade libraries, for example with maven-shade-plugin. That minimizes the size of the plugin .jar file by copying only the effective used classes.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block alert alert-info\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>The command <code>mvn dependency:tree</code> gives the list of all dependencies, including transitive ones.</p></div></div>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>The core component <a href=\"http://javadocs.sonarsource.org/latest/apidocs/index.html?org/sonar/api/config/Configuration.html\"><code>org.sonar.api.config.Configuration</code></a> provides access to configuration. It deals with default values and decryption of values. It is available in all stacks (scanner, web server, Compute Engine). As recommended earlier, it must not be called from constructors.</p>\n<p>MyExtension.java</p>\n<pre><code>public class MyRules implements RulesDefinition {\n  private final Configuration config;\n  \n  public MyRules(Configuration config) {   \n    this.config = config; \n  }\n  \n  @Override\n  public void define(Context context) {\n    int value = config.getInt(\"sonar.property\").orElse(0);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Scanner sensors can get config directly from SensorContext, without using constructor injection:</p>\n<p>MySensor.java</p>\n<pre><code>public class MySensor extends Sensor {\n  @Override\n  public void execute(SensorContext context) {\n    int value = context.config().getInt(\"sonar.property\").orElse(0);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the scanner stack, properties are checked in the following order, and the first non-blank value is the one that is used:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>System property</li>\n<li>Scanner command-line (-Dsonar.property=foo for instance)</li>\n<li>Scanner tool (<properties> of scanner for Maven for instance) </li>\n<li>Project configuration defined in the web UI </li>\n<li>Global configuration defined in the web UI </li>\n<li>Default value</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Plugins can define their own properties so that they can be configured from web administration console. The extension point org.sonar.api.config.PropertyDefinition must be used :</p>\n<pre><code>public class ExamplePlugin implements Plugin {\n  @Override\n  public void define(Context context) {\n    context.addExtension(\n      PropertyDefinition.builder(\"sonar.my.property\")\n       .name(\"My Property\")\n       .description(\"This is the description displayed in web admin console\")\n       .defaultValue(\"42\")\n       .build()\n    );\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"custom-block alert alert-info\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>Values of the properties suffixed with <code>.secured</code> are not available to non-authorized users (anonymous and users without project or global administration rights). <code>.secured</code> is needed for passwords, for instance.</p></div></div>\n<p>The annotation <a href=\"http://javadocs.sonarsource.org/latest/apidocs/index.html?org/sonar/api/Property.html\"><code>@org.sonar.api.Property</code></a> can also be used on an extension to declare a property, but org.sonar.api.config.PropertyDefinition is preferred.</p>\n<pre><code>@Properties(\n    @Property(key=\"sonar.my.property\", name=\"My Property\", defaultValue=\"42\")\n)\npublic class MySensor implements Sensor {\n  // ...\n}\n  \npublic class ExamplePlugin implements Plugin {\n  @Override\n  public void define(Context context) {\n    context.addExtension(MySensor.class);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Logging</h3>\n<p>The class <a href=\"http://javadocs.sonarsource.org/latest/apidocs/index.html?org/sonar/api/utils/log/Logger.html\"><code>org.sonar.api.utils.log.Logger</code></a> is used to log messages to scanner output, web server logs/sonar.log, or Compute Engine logs (available from administration web console). It's convenient for unit testing (see class <a href=\"http://javadocs.sonarsource.org/latest/apidocs/index.html?org/sonar/api/utils/log/LogTester.html\"><code>LogTester</code></a>).</p>\n<pre><code>import org.sonar.api.utils.log.*;\npublic class MyClass {\n  private static final Logger LOGGER = Loggers.get(MyClass.class);\n \n  public void doSomething() {\n    LOGGER.info(\"foo\");\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Internally <a href=\"http://www.slf4j.org/\">SLF4J</a> is used as a facade of various logging frameworks (log4j, commons-log, logback, java.util.logging). That allows all these frameworks to work at runtime, such as when they are required for a 3rd party library. SLF4J loggers can also be used instead of org.sonar.api.utils.log.Logger. Read the <a href=\"http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html\">SLF4J manual</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>As an exception, plugins must not package logging libraries. Dependencies like SLF4J or log4j must be declared with scope \"provided\".</p>\n<h3>Exposing APIs to Other Plugins</h3>\n<p>The common use case is to write a language plugin that will allow some other plugins to contribute additional rules (see for example how it is done in SonarJava). The main plugin will expose some APIs that will be implemented/used by the \"rule\" plugins.</p>\n<p>Plugins are loaded in isolated classloaders. It means a plugin can't access another plugin's classes. There is an exception for package names following pattern <code>org.sonar.plugins.&#x3C;pluginKey>.api</code>. For example all classes in a plugin with the key myplugin that are located in <code>org.sonar.plugins.myplugin.api</code> are visible to other plugins.</p>\n<h3>Serving Static Resources</h3>\n<p>If you need to serve static resources from your plugin such as images or JavaScript files, place them in a directory under <code>resources</code> named <code>static</code> (<code>myplugin/src/main/resources/static</code>). At runtime they'll be available from <code>http://{server}/static/{pluginKey}/{file}</code>. </p>\n<h2>Versioning and API Deprecation</h2>\n<h3>Versioning Strategy</h3>\n<p>The goal of this versioning strategy is both to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Release often, release early in order to get quick feedback from the SonarQube community</li>\n<li>Release stable versions of the SonarQube platform for companies whose main priority is to set up a very stable environment. Even if the price for such stable environments is missing out on the latest, sexy SonarQube features</li>\n<li>Support the API deprecation strategy (see next section)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rules are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each ~two months a new version of SonarQube is released. This version should increment the minor digit of the previous version (ex: 4.2 -> 4.3)</li>\n<li>After three (or more) releases, a bug-fix version is released, and becomes the new LTS. The major digit of the subsequent version is incremented to start a new cycle (ex: 5.6 -> 6.0)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And here is the strategy in action:</p>\n<pre><code>4.4 -> 4.5 -> 5.0 -> 5.1 -> 5.2 -> ... -> 5.5 -> 6.0 -> ...     &#x3C;- New release every ~2 months\n        |                                  |\n      4.5.1 -> 4.5.2 -> ...              5.5.1 -> 5.5.2 -> ...  &#x3C;- New LTS\n</code></pre>\n<h3>API Deprecation Strategy</h3>\n<p>The goal of this deprecation strategy is to make sure that deprecated APIs will be dropped without side-effects at a given planned date. The expected consequence of such strategy is to ease the evolution of the SonarQube API by making such refactoring painless.</p>\n<p>The rules are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An API must be deprecated before being dropped</li>\n<li>A deprecated API must be fully supported until its drop (For instance the implementation of a deprecated method can't be replaced by <code>throw new UnsupportedOperationException())</code></li>\n<li>If an API is deprecated in version X.Y, this API will be dropped in version (X+2).0. Example: an API deprecated in 4.1 is supported in 4.2, 4.3, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and is dropped in version 6.0.</li>\n<li>According to the versioning strategy, that means that an API can remain deprecated before being dropped during 6 to 12 months.</li>\n<li>Any release of a SonarQube plugin must at least depend on the latest LTS version of the SonarQube API</li>\n<li>For each SonarQube plugin there must at least one release on each LTS version of SonarQube, which means at least one release each 6 months.</li>\n<li>No use of deprecated APIs is accepted when releasing a plugin. It raises a critical issue in SonarQube analysis. This issue can't be postponed.</li>\n<li>No deprecated API introduced 2 major versions ago is accepted when releasing SonarQube. It raises a critical issue in SonarQube analysis. This issue can't be postponed.</li>\n<li>\n<p>An API is marked as deprecated with both:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the annotation @Deprecated</li>\n<li>\n<p>the javadoc tag @deprecated whose message must start with \"in x.y\", for example:</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>@deprecated in 4.2.

All the pages should be declared in this class.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>import org.sonar.api.web.page.Page;\nimport org.sonar.api.web.page.PageDefinition;\nimport org.sonar.api.web.page.Context;\n\nimport static org.sonar.api.web.page.Page.Scope.COMPONENT;\nimport static org.sonar.api.web.page.Page.Qualifier.VIEW;\nimport static org.sonar.api.web.page.Page.Qualifier.SUB_VIEW;\n \npublic class MyPluginPageDefinition implements PageDefinition {\n  @Override\n  public void define(Context context) {\n    context\n      .addPage(Page.builder(\"my_plugin/global_page\")\n        .setName(\"Global Page\")\n        .build())\n      .addPage(Page.builder(\"my_plugin/project_page\")\n        .setName(\"Project Page\")\n        .setScope(COMPONENT)\n        .build())\n      .addPage(Page.builder(\"my_plugin/portfolio_page\")\n        .setName(\"Portfolio Page\")\n        .setScope(COMPONENT)\n        .setComponentQualifiers(VIEW, SUB_VIEW)\n        .build())\n      .addPage(Page.builder(\"my_plugin/admin_page\")\n        .setName(\"Admin Page\")\n        .setAdmin(true)\n        .build());\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Configuring each page</h3>\n<p>There are 3 settings available when you define the page extensions using the <code>PageDefinition</code> class:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>setAdmin(boolean admin)</code>: flag this page as restricted to users with \"administer\" permission. Defaults to <code>false</code>.</li>\n<li><code>setScope(org.sonar.api.web.page.Page.Scope scope)</code>: set the scope of this page. Available scopes are <code>GLOBAL</code> (default), which will add this page to the main menu, and <code>COMPONENT</code>, which will add the page to a project, application, or portfolio menu (applications and portfolios only apply to Enterprise Edition and above).</li>\n<li><code>setComponentQualifiers(org.sonar.api.web.page.Qualifier... qualifiers)</code>: if <code>setScope()</code> is set to <code>COMPONENT</code>, this sets to what kind of component the page applies to. Available qualifiers are <code>PROJECT</code>, <code>APP</code>, <code>VIEW</code> (portfolio), and <code>SUB_VIEW</code> (<code>APP</code>, <code>VIEW</code>, and <code>SUB_VIEW</code> only apply to Enterprise Edition and above). You can pass multiple qualifiers. If no qualifier is set, it will apply to all types.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 2. Create a JavaScript file per page</h2>\n<p>The <code>PageDefinition</code> will register each key as an available route in SonarQube. Whenever this route is visited, SonarQube will asynchronously fetch a single JavaScript file from your plugin's <code>/static/</code> directory, and boot up your page's application. This file should have the same name as the <code>page_id</code> you defined in your <code>PageDefinition</code> class. In the example in Step 1, you would need 4 different JavaScript files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/static/global_page.js</code></li>\n<li><code>/static/project_page.js</code></li>\n<li><code>/static/portfolio_page.js</code></li>\n<li><code>/static/admin_page.js</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each file <em>must</em> call the global <code>window.registerExtension()</code> function, and pass its <em>full key</em> as a first argument (<code>plugin_key/page_id</code>, e.g.: <code>governance/project_dump</code>). The second argument is the <em>start</em> callback. This function will be called once your page is started, and receive information about the current page as an argument (see below). The return value of the start callback depends on how you want to implement your page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to use <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>, you should return a React Component:</p>\n<pre><code>// static/global_page.js\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport App from \"./components/App\";\n\nwindow.registerExtension('my_plugin/global_page', function (options) {\nreturn &#x3C;App options={options} />\n});\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to use any other framework, you should perform any start logic directly inside the start function body, and <strong>return a shutdown callback</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code>// static/global_page.js\nconst init = require(\"./my-app/init\");\n\nwindow.registerExtension('my_plugin/global_page', function (options) {\n// Start up my custom application, passing the DOM element which will serve as\n// the container.\ninit.boot(options.el, options.currentUser, options.component);\n\n// Whenever the user leaves the page, cleanly shut everything down\n// (i.e., remove event listeners, stop running timers, etc).\nreturn function () {\n  init.removeEventListeners();\n  init.clearState();\n  init.shutdown();\n};\n});\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>options</code> object will contain the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>options.el</code>: a DOM node you must use to inject your content.</li>\n<li><code>options.currentUser</code>: information about the current user.</li>\n<li>(optional) <code>options.component</code>: contains the information of the current project, application, or portfolio.</li>\n<li>(optional) <code>options.branchLike</code>: contains the information of the current branch or pull request.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"custom-block alert alert-info\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>SonarQube doesn't guarantee any JavaScript library availability at runtime (except React).

When it's time to update your language pack for a new version of SonarQube or a plugin, the easiest way to see what keys are missing is to run:</p>\n<pre><code>mvn test\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the build fails, it means that some keys are missing. Go to <code>target/l10n</code> to check the reports for each bundle. Missing keys are listed under 'Missing translations are:'</p>\n<pre><code>Missing translations are:\ncode_viewer.no_info_displayed_due_to_security=Due to security settings, no information can be displayed.\ncomparison.version.latest=LATEST\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each time you add a new bundle or update an existing one, please create a JIRA ticket on the corresponding L10n component in order to track changes.</p>\n<h2>Localizing a Plugin</h2>\n<p>This section applies if you are developing a closed-source plugin.

If you are installing an instance for a large teams or Enterprise, please consider the additional recommendations below.</li>\n<li>The amount of disk space you need will depend on how much code you analyze with SonarQube. As an example, <a href=\"https://sonarcloud.io\">SonarCloud</a> the public instance of SonarQube, has more than 350 million lines of code under analysis with 5 years of history. SonarCloud is currently running on clustered <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">Amazon EC2 m5.large</a> instances with allocations of 50 Gb of drive space per node.

SonarCloud runs on PostgreSQL 9.5 and it is using about 250Gb of disk space for the database.</li>\n<li>SonarQube must be installed on hard drives that have excellent read &#x26; write performance. Most importantly, the \"data\" folder houses the Elasticsearch indices on which a huge amount of I/O will be done when the server is up and running. Great read &#x26; write hard drive performance will therefore have a great impact on the overall SonarQube server performance.</li>\n<li>SonarQube does not support 32-bit systems on the server side. SonarQube does, however, support 32-bit systems on the scanner side.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Enterprise Hardware Recommendations</h3>\n<p>For large teams or Enterprise-scale installations of SonarQube, additional hardware is required. At the Enterprise level, <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/instance-administration/monitoring/\">monitoring your SonarQube instance</a> is essential and should guide further hardware upgrades as your instance grows.

See -Xms and  -Xmx of property <code>sonar.search.javaOpts</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Disk</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Free disk space is an absolute requirement. ES implements a safety mechanism to prevent the disk from being flooded with index data that locks all indices in read-only mode when a 95% disk usage watermark is reached. For information on recovering from ES read-only indices, see the <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/setup/troubleshooting/\">Troubleshooting</a> page.</li>\n<li>Disk can easily  become the bottleneck of ES. If you can afford SSDs, they are by far superior to any spinning media. SSD-backed nodes see boosts in both query and indexing performance. If you use spinning media, try to obtain the fastest disks possible (high performance server disks 15k RPM drives).</li>\n<li>Make sure to increase the number of open files descriptors on the machine (or for the user running SonarQube server). Setting it to 32k or even 64k is recommended. See <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/file-descriptors.html\">this ElasticSearch article</a>.</li>\n<li>Using RAID 0 is an effective way to increase disk speed, for both spinning disks and SSD. There is no need to use mirroring or parity variants of RAID because of Elasticsearch replicas and database primary storage.\n8 Do not use remote-mounted storage, such as NFS, SMB/CIFS or network-attached storages (NAS). They are often slower, display larger latencies with a wider deviation in average latency, and are a single point of failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Advanced</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using SSD, make sure your OS I/O Scheduler is configured correctly. When you write data to disk, the I/O Scheduler decides when that data is actually sent to the disk. The default under most *nix distributions is a scheduler called cfq (Completely Fair Queuing). This scheduler allocates \"time slices\" to each process, and then optimizes the delivery of these various queues to the disk. It is optimized for spinning media: the nature of rotating platters means it is more efficient to write data to disk based on physical layout. This is very inefficient for SSD, however, since there are no spinning platters involved. Instead, deadline or noop should be used instead. The deadline scheduler optimizes based on how long writes have been pending, while noop is just a simple FIFO queue. This simple change can have dramatic impacts.</li>\n<li>If SQ home directory is located on a slow disk, then the property <code>sonar.path.data</code> can be used to move data to a faster disk (RAID 0 local SSD for instance).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Memory</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Machine available memory for OS must be at least the Elasticsearch heap size. The reason is that Lucene (used by ES) is designed to leverage the underlying OS for caching in-memory data structures. That means that by default OS must have at least 1Gb of available memory.</li>\n<li>Don't allocate more than 32Gb.

The second case should be carefully evaluated. In either case, when considering increasing the number of CE workers, two questions should be answered.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>does my infrastructure allow me to increase the number of workers?</li>\n<li>to what extent should I increase the number of workers? I.E. What number should I configure?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Increasing the number of workers will increase the stress on the resources consumed by the Compute Engine.

However, if your slowness is caused by large individual analysis reports hogging the CE worker for extended periods of time, then enabling parallel processing by adding another worker could help. But if you do, you need to take a look at the internal resources.</p>\n<p>CE workers are not CPU-intensive and memory use depends entirely on the project that was analyzed. Some need a lot of memory, others don't. But with multiple CE workers, you should increase CE heap size by a multiple of the number of workers. The same logic applies to CPU: if running with one worker consumes up to Y% of CPU, then you should plan for Z workers requiring Y*Z% of CPU.</p>\n<p>To accurately diagnose your situation, monitor network latency, the I/O of the SonarQube instance, and the database CPU and memory usage to evaluate whether slowness is mainly/mostly/only related to external resources. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/instance-administration/compute-engine-performance/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>SonarQube collects a maximum of measures in an automated manner but there are some measures for which this is not possible, such as when: the information is not available for collection, the measure is computed by a human, and so on.

Quality Profiles are defined for individual languages.</p>\n<p>To manage Quality Profiles, browse to the the <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube#/profiles\"><strong>Quality Profiles</strong></a> page  where you'll find Quality Profiles grouped by language.</p>\n<p>Ideally all of your projects will be measured with the same Quality Profiles, but that is not <em>always</em> practical. In some cases, you may find that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have different technical requirements from one project to another (different rules might apply to a threaded/non-threaded Java application)</li>\n<li>You want to ensure stronger requirements for some of your projects (internal frameworks, for example)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it's recommended to have as few Quality Profiles as possible to ensure consistency across projects, you can define as many Quality Profiles as are necessary to fit your specific needs.</p>\n<p>Each language must have a default Quality Profile (marked with the Default tag). Projects that are not explicitly assigned to specific Quality Profiles will be analyzed using the default Quality Profiles. There is also at least one built-in Quality Profile (the <strong>Sonar way</strong>) per language. These Quality Profiles are designed by SonarSource with rules that are generally applicable for most projects. </p>\n<p>The Sonar way Quality Profiles are a good starting-point as you begin analyzing code, and they start out as the default Quality Profiles for each language. That being said, we recommend that you <strong>Copy</strong> this profile and begin to fine-tune the contents. Why?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default Quality Profiles are not editable, so you won't be able to customize the Sonar way to your needs</li>\n<li>The Sonar way becomes a baseline against which you can track your own Quality Profiles</li>\n<li>The Sonar way may be updated over time to adjust which rules are included and adjust rule severities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How do I...</h2>\n<h3>Delegate the management of Quality Profiles to someone else?</h3>\n<p>By default, only users with the \"Administer Quality Profiles\" permission can edit Quality Profiles. But in large organizations, it may not be desirable to grant permissions to change all the Quality Profiles without distinction. That's why you can also grant users/groups the permission to edit an individual Quality Profile so that, for instance, the management of the Swift profile can be delegated to a group of Swift experts, and the same for COBOL, ...</p>\n<p>This delegation of permission can only be performed by someone who already has the \"Administer Quality Profiles\" permission or individual edit rights on the profile to which additional permissions should be granted. The interface to grant individual permissions is available on the profile detail page.</p>\n<h3>Copy the rules from one profile to another?</h3>\n<p>Many times people want to work from a profile that's based on a built-in profile without actually using the built-in profile. The easiest thing to do in this case is to go to the original profile, we'll call it <em>Source</em>, in <strong>Quality Profiles</strong>. From there, click through on the total number of rules in <em>Source</em> to land on the <strong>Rules</strong> page at a pre-narrowed search of <em>Source</em>'s rules. Use <strong>Bulk Activate</strong> to turn Source's rules on in your target profile.</p>\n<h3>Know what's changed in a profile?</h3>\n<p>When SonarQube notices that an analysis was performed with a profile that is different in some way from the previous analysis, a Quality Profile event is added to the project's event log. To see the changes in a profile, navigate to the profile (<strong>Quality Profiles > [ Profile Name ]</strong>), and choose <strong>Changelog</strong>. This may help you understand how profile changes impact the issues raised in an analysis.</p>\n<p>Additionally, users with Quality Profile administration privileges are notified by email each time a built-in profile (one that is provided directly by an analyzer) is updated. These updates can only be caused by analyzer updates.</p>\n<h3>Copy a profile from one SonarQube instance to another?</h3>\n<p>Use the <strong>Back up</strong> feature on the source instance to export the profile to an XML file. Use the <strong>Restore Profile</strong> feature on the target instance to import the file. Note that some <a href=\"https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/SONAR-5366\">limitations</a> on this feature exist.</p>\n<h3>Apply a core set of rules plus additional rules to a project?</h3>\n<p>Let's say your company has a minimum set of coding rules that all teams must follow, but you want to add rules that are specific to the in use technology in your project. Those rules are good for your team, but irrelevant or even misleading for others. This situation calls for inheritance. Set up a base profile, we'll call it <em>Root</em> with your core set of rules. Then create a child profile, we'll call it <em>Sprout</em>. Once it's created, you can <strong>Change parent</strong> to inherit from <em>Root</em>, then add your missing rules.</p>\n<p>Any profile that inherits from another Quality Profile will be updated when the parent Quality Profile is updated.</p>\n<h3>Make sure my non-default profile is used on a project?</h3>\n<p>One profile for each language is marked the default. Barring any other intervention, all projects that use that language will be analyzed with that profile. To have a project analyzed by a non-default profile instead, start from <strong>Quality Profiles</strong>, and click through on your target profile, then use the Projects part of the interface to manage which projects are explicitly assigned to the profile.</p>\n<h3>Make sure I've got all the relevant new rules in my profile?</h3>\n<p>Each time a language plugin update is released, new rules are added, but they won't appear automatically in your profile unless you're using a built-in profile such as <em>Sonar way</em>.</p>\n<p>If you're not using a built-in profile, you can compare your profile to the built-in profile to see what new on-by-default rules you're missing.</p>\n<p>Another option is to go to the <strong>Rules</strong> space, and use the <strong>Available Since</strong> search facet to see what rules have been added to the platform since the day you upgraded the relevant plugin.</p>\n<p>And finally, the profile interface itself will help you be aware of rules added in a new plugin version in the <strong>Latest New Rules</strong> section on the right of the interface.</p>\n<h3>Compare two profiles?</h3>\n<p>Starting from the <strong>Quality Profiles</strong> page, click through on one of the profiles you'd like to compare, then use the <strong>Actions > Compare</strong> interface to select the second profile and see the differences.</p>\n<h3>Make sure I don't have any deprecated rules in my profile?</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Deprecated Rules</strong> section of the rules interface itself is your first warning that a profile contains deprecated rules. This pink-background section gives the total number of instances of deprecated rules that are currently active in profiles, and a breakdown of deprecated count per profile. A click-through here takes you to the <strong>Rules</strong> page to edit the profile in question.</p>\n<p>Alternately, you can perform a <strong>Rules</strong> search for the rules in a profile (either manually or by clicking-through from <strong>Quality Profiles</strong> page) and use the <strong>Status</strong> rule search facet to narrow the list to the ones that need attention.</p>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<p>The Quality Profiles service can be accessed by any user (even anonymous users). All users can view every aspect of a profile. That means anyone can see which rules are included in a profile, and which ones have been left out, see how a profile has changed over time, and compare the rules in any two profiles.</p>\n<p>To make rule profile changes (create, edit or delete) users must be granted the <strong>Administer Quality Profiles and Gates</strong> permission.</p>\n<p>A <strong>project administrator</strong> can choose which profiles his project is associated with. See Project Settings for more.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/instance-administration/quality-profiles/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>SonarQube comes with a number of global security features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>on-board authentication and authorization mechanisms</li>\n<li>the ability to force users to authenticate before they can see any part of a SonarQube instance</li>\n<li>the ability to delegate to authentication (for more see <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/instance-administration/delegated-auth/\">Delegating Authentication</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, you can configure at a group or user level who can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>see that a project even exists</li>\n<li>access a project's source code </li>\n<li>administer a project (set exclusion patterns, tune plugin configuration for that project, etc.)</li>\n<li>administer Quality Profiles, Quality Gates, and the SonarQube instance itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another aspect of security is the encryption of settings such as passwords. SonarQube provides a built-in mechanism to encrypt settings.</p>\n<h2>Authentication</h2>\n<p>The first question that should be answered when setting the security strategy for SonarQube is: Can anonymous users browse the SonarQube instance or is authentication be required? </p>\n<p>To force user authentication, log in as a system administrator, go to <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings?category=security\">Administration > Configuration > General Settings > Security</a></strong>, and set the <strong>Force user authentication</strong> property to true. </p>\n<div class=\"custom-block alert alert-info\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>SonarQube does not support sharing email addresses across multiple users.</p></div></div>\n<h3>Authentication Mechanisms</h3>\n<p>Authentication can be managed through a number of mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Via the SonarQube built-in users/groups database</li>\n<li>Via external identity providers such as an LDAP server (including LDAP Service of Active Directory), GitHub etc. See the Authentication &#x26; Authorization section of the Plugin Library.</li>\n<li>Via HTTP headers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Technical Users</h3>\n<p>When you create a user in SonarQube's own database, it is considered local and will only be authenticated against SonarQube's own user/group database rather than against any external tool (LDAP, Active Directory, Crowd, etc.). By default <code>admin</code> is a local account.</p>\n<p>Similarly, all non-local accounts will be authenticated only against the external tool. </p>\n<p>An Administrator can manage tokens on a user's behalf via <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/users\">Administration > Security > Users</a></strong>. From here, click in the user's <strong>Tokens</strong> column to see the user's existing tokens, and either revoke existing tokens or generate new ones. Once established, a token is the only credential needed to run an analysis. Tokens should be passed as the value of the <code>sonar.login</code> property.</p>\n<h3>Default Admin Credentials</h3>\n<p>When installing SonarQube, a default user with Administer System permission is created automatically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Login: admin</li>\n<li>Password: admin</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Reinstating Admin Access</h2>\n<p>If you changed and then lost the <code>admin</code> password, you can reset it using the following query:</p>\n<pre><code>update users set crypted_password = '$2a$12$uCkkXmhW5ThVK8mpBvnXOOJRLd64LJeHTeCkSuB3lfaR2N0AYBaSi', salt=null, hash_method='BCRYPT' where login = 'admin'\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you've deleted <code>admin</code> and subsequently locked out the other users with global administrative permissions, you'll need to re-grant <code>admin</code> to a user with the following query:</p>\n<pre><code>INSERT INTO user_roles(user_id, role, organization_uuid) \nVALUES ((select id from users where login='mylogin'), \nadmin', \n(select uuid from organizations where kee='default-organization'));\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Authorization</h2>\n<p>The way authorization is implemented in SonarQube is pretty standard. It is possible to create as many users and groups of users as needed. The users can then be attached (or not) to (multiple) groups. Groups and / or users are then given (multiple) permissions. The permissions grant access to projects, services and functionalities.</p>\n<p>To administer groups and users, choose <strong>Administration > Security</strong>, and use the sub-menu items.</p>\n<h3>User</h3>\n<p>Multiple integrations that allow the delegation of authentication are available (see the <a href=\"https://redirect.sonarsource.com/doc/plugin-library.html\">Plugin Library</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/PLUG/Other+Plugins\">Other Plugins</a>, but you can manually create and edit users at <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/users\">Settings > Security > Users</a></strong>. For manually-created users, login and password can be set at creation. Manually-created users can edit their passwords.</p>\n<p>During both user creation and edit, you can set an account's screen name, email address. User login and email address will be implicitly recognized by the Issue Assignment feature as SCM accounts if applicable, but you can set additional SCM accounts explicitly. </p>\n<h3>Group</h3>\n<p>A group is a set of users.</p>\n<p>To administer groups, go to <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/groups\">Administration > Security > Groups</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>To edit the membership of a group, click the icon next to the membership total.</p>\n<p>Two groups have a special meaning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anyone</strong> is a group that exists in the system, but that cannot be managed. Every user belongs to this group, including Anonymous user.</li>\n<li><strong>sonar-users</strong> is the default group to which users are automatically added.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Global Permissions</h3>\n<p>To set global permissions, log in as a System administrator and go to <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/permissions\">Administration > Security > Global Permissions</a></strong>. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Administer System</strong>: All administration functions for the instance: global configuration.</li>\n<li><strong>Administer Quality Profiles</strong>: Any action on quality profiles.</li>\n<li><strong>Administer Quality Gates</strong>: Any action on quality gates</li>\n<li><strong>Execute Analysis</strong>: Execute analyses (project, view, report, developer), and to get all settings required to perform the analysis, even the secured ones like the scm account password, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Create Projects</strong>: Initialize the structure of a new project before its first analysis. This permission is also required when doing the very first analysis of a project that has not already been created via the GUI. * **</li>\n<li><strong>Create Applications</strong>: Create a new Application. * **</li>\n<li><strong>Create Portfolios</strong>: Create a new Portfolio. * **</li>\n</ul>\n<p>* Users with any explicit create permission will see a \"+\" item in the top menu giving access to these functions. If these permissions are removed from global administrators, they will loose quick access to them via the \"+\" menu, <strong>but retain access to creation</strong> via the <strong>Administration</strong> menu.</p>\n<p>** Creating an item does not automatically grant rights to administer it. For that, see <em>Creators permission</em> below.</p>\n<h3>Project Permissions</h3>\n<p>Project permissions are available from the project-level Administration menu: <strong>Administration > Permissions</strong>.</p>\n<p>Project visibility may be toggled between public or private. Making a project private hides its source code and measures from the <code>Anyone</code> group. For both public and private projects, four different permissions can be set:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Administer Issues</strong>: Change the type and severity of issues, resolve issues as being \"Won't Fix\" or \"False Positive\" (users also need \"Browse\" permission).</li>\n<li><strong>Administer Security Hotspots</strong>: Change the status of a Security Hotspot.</li>\n<li><strong>Administer</strong>: Access project settings and perform administration tasks (users also need \"Browse\" permission).</li>\n<li><strong>Execute Analysis</strong>: Execute analyses (project, view, report, developer), and to get all settings required to perform the analysis, even the secured ones like the scm account password, the jira account password, and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Private projects have two additional permissions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Browse</strong>: Access a project; browse its measures, issues, and Security Hotspots; perform some issue edits (confirm/resolve/reopen, assignment, comment); comment on or change the user assigned to a Security Hotspot.</li>\n<li><strong>See Source Code</strong>: View the project's source code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that permissions <em>are not</em> cumulative. For instance, if you want to be able to administer the project, you also have to be granted the Browse permission to be able to access the project (which is the default for Public project).</p>\n<p>You can either manually grant permissions for each project to some users and groups or apply permission templates to projects. </p>\n<h2>Permission Templates for Default Permissions</h2>\n<p>SonarQube ships with a default permissions template, which automatically grants specific permissions to certain groups when a project, portfolio, or application is created. It is possible to edit this template, and to create additional templates. A separate template can be set for each type of resource. Further, for projects you can have a template apply only to a subset of new projects using a project key regular expression (the template's <strong>Project Key Pattern</strong>). By default, every new project with a key that matches the supplied pattern will have template's permissions applied.</p>\n<p>Templates are empty immediately after creation. Clicking on the template name will take you to its permission editing interface.</p>\n<p>Templates are administered through <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/permission_templates\">Administration > Security > Permission Templates</a></strong>.</p>\n<h3>Creators permissions</h3>\n<p><strong>Creators</strong> is a special group that appears only in the permission template editing interface. Any permissions assigned to this group will at the time of project/portfolio/application creation be granted to the single user account used to create the project. This allows SonarQube administrators to let users autonomously create and administer their own projects.</p>\n<p>While templates can be applied after project creation, applying a template that includes \"Creators\" permissions to an existing project/portfolio/application will not grant the relevant permissions to the project's original creator because that association is not stored.</p>\n<h3>Reset project permissions to a template</h3>\n<p>To apply permission templates to projects go to <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/projects_management\">Administration > Projects > Management</a></strong>. You can  either apply a template to a specific project using the project-specific <strong>Actions > Apply Permission Template</strong> option or use the Bulk Apply Permission Template to apply a template to all selected projects.</p>\n<p>Note that there is no relation between a project and a permission template, meaning that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the permissions of a project can be modified after a permission template has been applied to this project</li>\n<li>none of the project permissions is changed when a permission template is modified</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Settings Encryption</h2>\n<p>Encryption is mostly used to remove clear passwords from settings (database or SCM credentials for instance). The implemented solution is based on a symetric key algorithm. The key point is that the secret key is stored in a secured file on disk. This file must owned by and readable only by the system account that runs the SonarQube server.</p>\n<p>The algorithm is AES 128 bits. Note that 256 bits cipher is not used because it's not supported by default on all Java Virtual Machines (<a href=\"https://confluence.terena.org/display/~visser/No+256+bit+ciphers+for+Java+apps\">see this article</a>).</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Generate the secret key</strong><br>\nA unique secret key must be shared between all parts of the SonarQube infrastructure (server and analyzers). To generate it, go to <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings/encryption\">Administration > Configuration > Encryption</a></strong> and click on Generate Secret Key.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Store the secret key on the SonarQube server</strong>  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copy the generated secred key to a file on the machine hosting the SonarQube server.

It doesn't keep all previous analyses - that would bloat the database. Similarly, for the analyses it does keep, SonarQube doesn't keep all the data.

This behavior can be disabled.

Go to <strong>Administration > General Settings > [Language]</strong> to set the File suffixes property.</p>\n<h3>Choosing Files</h3>\n<p>Your first line of defence having a well-defined set of files in your analysis is your <code>sonar.sources</code> value. For projects built and analyzed with Maven, Gradle, or MSBuild, this value is defined automatically with a generally thorough, yet sane value. For other projects, you want to make sure <code>sonar.sources</code> is set to your project <em>sub-directory</em> that actually contains your source files. Setting it to <code>.</code> will cast a wider net than most people intend.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/sources.jpg\" alt=\"Set sonar.sources to the project sub-directory that contains your source files\"></p>\n<p>Once you've got all the files <em>in</em> your analysis that you want, it's time to look at whether you have any files you'd rather leave <em>out</em> of your analysis, such as JavaScript libraries, and generated files. Those can be handled with Exclusions. Specifying an exclusion means that everything under your <code>sonar.sources</code> directory will be included in analysis <em>except</em> the files with paths that match your exclusion regular expression.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/exclusions.jpg\" alt=\"Use exclusions to keep libraries and generated files out of analysis\"></p>\n<p>To use exclusions to analyze everything but the specified files, go to <strong>Administration > General Settings > Analysis Scope > Files</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Source File Exclusions</strong> (<code>sonar.exclusions</code>) - to exclude source code files</li>\n<li><strong>Test File Exclusions</strong> (<code>sonar.test.exclusions</code>) - to exclude test files</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The vast majority of needs are met simply by setting <code>sonar.sources</code> carefully. Most other needs are met with the addition of a few simple exclusions. In a few corner cases, it is necessary to be explicit about what's <em>included</em> in analysis and leave out everything else, but that is not the normal case, and setting inclusions should not be the first thing you try when configuring a new project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/inclusions.jpg\" alt=\"Use inclusions in the rare case that you want to analyze only a subset of files\"></p>\n<p>To use exclusions to analyze <em>only</em> the specified subset(s) of files in <code>sonar.sources</code>, go to <strong>Administration > General Settings > Analysis Scope > Files</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Source File Inclusions</strong> (<code>sonar.inclusions</code>)</li>\n<li><strong>Test File Inclusions</strong> (<code>sonar.test.inclusions</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can set these properties at both the project and global levels.</p>\n<p>See the Patterns section below for more details on the syntax to use in these inputs.</p>\n<h2>Ignore Issues</h2>\n<p>You can have SonarQube ignore issues on certain components and against certain coding rules.

You can do this by validating a hash signature that ensures that requests originate from SonarQube. </p>\n<h3>Setting your secret</h3>\n<p>To set your secret in SonarQube:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the project or organization where you're securing your webhooks, navigate to the webhooks settings at <strong>Administration > webhooks</strong></li>\n<li>You can either click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new webhook or click an existing webhook's settings drop-down and click <strong>Update</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter a random string in the <strong>Secret</strong> text box. This is used as the key to generate the HMAC hex digest value in the <code>X-Sonar-Webhook-HMAC-SHA256</code> header.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Update</strong>. </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Validating SonarQube Payloads</h3>\n<p>After setting your secret, it's used by SonarQube to create a hash signature with each payload that's passed using the <code>X-Sonar-Webhook-HMAC-SHA256</code> HTTP header. The header value needs to match the signature you are expecting to receive. SonarQube uses a HMAC lower-case SHA256 digest to compute the signature of the request body. Here's some sample Java code for your server:</p>\n<pre><code>private static boolean isValidSignature(YourHttpRequest request) {\n  String receivedSignature = request.getHeader(\"X-Sonar-Webhook-HMAC-SHA256\");\n  // See Apache commons-codec\n  String expectedSignature = new HmacUtils(HmacAlgorithms.HMAC_SHA_256, \"your_secret\").hmacHex(request.getBody())\n  return Objects.equals(expectedSignature, receivedSignature);  \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the signatures don't match, then the payload should be ignored.</p>\n<h2>Additional parameters</h2>\n<p>A basic authentication mechanism is supported by providing user/password in the URL of the Webhook such as <code>https://myLogin:myPassword@my_server/foo</code>.</p>\n<p>If you provide additional properties to your SonarScanner using the pattern <code>sonar.analysis.*</code>, these properties will be automatically added to the section \"properties\" of the payload.</p>\n<p>For example these additional parameters:</p>\n<pre><code>sonar-scanner -Dsonar.analysis.buildNumber=12345\n</code></pre>\n<p>Would add this to the payload:</p>\n<pre><code>\"properties\": {\n  \"sonar.analysis.buildNumber\": \"12345\"\n}\n</code></pre>","fields":{"slug":"/project-administration/webhooks/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>SonarCloud can autonomously scan your code, by simply reading it from your repository!

It also uses marginally services located in the AWS Ireland region when they are not available in Frankfurt.</p>\n<h2>System security</h2>\n<p>SonarCloud uses its own Virtual Private Cloud (AWS VPC). Accesses to the infrastructure are restricted through firewalls, allowing accesses from SonarSource networks only. Secure protocols are required for accesses and SSL keys are used for authentication. Access to the infrastructure, inclusive of storage, is restricted to the Technology Operations team.</p>\n<h2>Data security</h2>\n<p>At the infrastructure level, access to data is controlled by virtue of being hosted in network zones which only the Technology Operations have access to. </p>\n<p>To insure data availability, the SonarCloud database is replicated in quasi real time between 2 availability zones both within the Frankfurt region.

If you don't have one yet, please contact the SonarSource Sales Team.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>Don't start this journey alone!  As a Data Center Edition subscriber, SonarSource will assist with the setup and configuration of your cluster. Get in touch with <a href=\"https://support.sonarsource.com\">SonarSource Support</a> for help.</p>\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\n<p>Additional parameters are required to activate clustering capabilities and specialize each node. These parameters are in addition to standard configuration properties used in a single-node configuration.</p>\n<p>The <strong>sonar.properties</strong> file on each node will be edited to configure the node's specialization. A list of all cluster-specific configuration parameters is available in the <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/setup/operate-cluster/\">Operate the Cluster</a> documentation.</p>\n<p>Prior to configuration, you will need to generate a value for the <code>sonar.auth.jwtBase64Hs256Secret</code> property for the application nodes.  The value is a HS256 key encoded with base64 and will be the same for both nodes.  The following is an example on how to generate this value on a Unix system:</p>\n<pre><code>echo -n \"your_secret\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"your_key\" -binary | base64\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Configuration</h3>\n<p>The following example represents the minimal parameters required to configure a SonarQube cluster.  The example assumes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The VMs having IP addresses ip1 and ip2 (server1, server2) are application nodes</li>\n<li>The VMs having IP addresses ip3, ip4, and ip5 (server3, server4 and server5) are search nodes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The configuration to be added to sonar.properties for each node is the following:</p>\n<h4>Application Nodes</h4>\n<p><strong>server1</strong></p>\n<pre><code>...\nsonar.cluster.enabled=true\nsonar.cluster.hosts=ip1,ip2\nsonar.cluster.search.hosts=ip3,ip4,ip5\nsonar.cluster.node.type=application\nsonar.auth.jwtBase64Hs256Secret=YOURGENERATEDSECRET\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>server2</strong></p>\n<pre><code>...\nsonar.cluster.enabled=true\nsonar.cluster.hosts=ip1,ip2\nsonar.cluster.search.hosts=ip3,ip4,ip5\nsonar.cluster.node.type=application\nsonar.auth.jwtBase64Hs256Secret=YOURGENERATEDSECRET\n...\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Search Nodes</h4>\n<p><strong>server3</strong></p>\n<pre><code>...\nsonar.cluster.enabled=true\nsonar.cluster.search.hosts=ip3,ip4,ip5\nsonar.cluster.node.type=search\nsonar.search.host=ip3\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>server4</strong></p>\n<pre><code>...\nsonar.cluster.enabled=true\nsonar.cluster.search.hosts=ip3,ip4,ip5\nsonar.cluster.node.type=search\nsonar.search.host=ip4\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>server5</strong></p>\n<pre><code>...\nsonar.cluster.enabled=true\nsonar.cluster.search.hosts=ip3,ip4,ip5\nsonar.cluster.node.type=search\nsonar.search.host=ip5\n...\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sample Installation Process</h2>\n<p>The following is an example of the default SonarQube cluster installation process. You need to tailor your installation to the specifics of the target installation environment and the operational requirements of the hosting organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Prepare the cluster environment:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prepare the cluster environment by setting up the network and provisioning the nodes and load balancer. </li>\n<li>Follow the <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/setup/install-server/\">Installing the Server</a> documentation to configure the database server.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Prepare a personalized SonarQube package:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On a single application node of the cluster, download and install SonarQube Data Center Edition, following the usual <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/setup/install-server/\">Installing the Server</a> documentation.</li>\n<li>Add cluster-related parameters to <code>$SONARQUBE_HOME/conf/sonar.properties</code>.</li>\n<li>As the Marketplace is not available in SonarQube Data Center Edition, this is a good opportunity to install additional plugins. Download and place a copy of each plugin JAR in <code>$SONARQUBE_HOME/extensions/plugins</code>.  Be sure to check compatibility with your SonarQube version using the <a href=\"https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/PLUG/Plugin+Version+Matrix\">Plugin Version Matrix</a>.</li>\n<li>Zip the directory <code>$SONARQUBE_HOME</code>. This archive is a customized SonarQube Data Center Edition package that can be copied to other nodes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Test configuration on a single node:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the application node where you created your Zip package, comment out all cluster-related parameters in <code>$SONARQUBE_HOME/conf/sonar.properties</code>.</li>\n<li>Configure the load balancer to proxy with single application node.</li>\n<li>Start server and test access through load balancer.</li>\n<li>Request license from SonarSource Sales Team.</li>\n<li>After applying license, you will have a full-featured SonarQube system operating on a single node.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Deploy SonarQube package on other nodes:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unzip SonarQube package on the other four nodes.</li>\n<li>Configure node-specific parameters on all five nodes in <code>$SONARQUBE_HOME/conf/sonar.properties</code> and ensure application node-specific and search node-specific parameters are properly set.</li>\n<li>Start all search nodes.</li>\n<li>After all search nodes are running, start all application nodes.</li>\n<li>Configure the load balancer to proxy with both application nodes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Congratulations, you have a fully-functional SonarQube cluster.

Templates are available for every supported database. Just uncomment and configure the template you need and comment out the lines dedicated to H2:</p>\n<pre><code>Example for PostgreSQL\nsonar.jdbc.username=sonarqube\nsonar.jdbc.password=mypassword\nsonar.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/sonarqube\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Adding the JDBC Driver</h3>\n<p>Drivers for the supported databases (except Oracle) are already provided. Do not replace the provided drivers; they are the only ones supported.</p>\n<p>For Oracle, copy the JDBC driver into <em>$SONARQUBE-HOME/extensions/jdbc-driver/oracle</em>.</p>\n<h3>Configuring the Elasticsearch storage path</h3>\n<p>By default, Elasticsearch data is stored in <em>$SONARQUBE-HOME/data</em>, but this is not recommended for production instances. Instead, you should store this data elsewhere, ideally in a dedicated volume with fast I/O. Beyond maintaining acceptable performance, doing so will also ease the upgrade of SonarQube.</p>\n<p>Edit <em>$SONARQUBE-HOME/conf/sonar.properties</em> to configure the following settings:</p>\n<pre><code>sonar.path.data=/var/sonarqube/data\nsonar.path.temp=/var/sonarqube/temp\n</code></pre>\n<p>The user used to launch SonarQube must have read and write access to those directories.</p>\n<h3>Starting the Web Server</h3>\n<p>The default port is \"9000\" and the context path is \"/\". These values can be changed in <em>$SONARQUBE-HOME/conf/sonar.properties</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>sonar.web.host=192.0.0.1\nsonar.web.port=80\nsonar.web.context=/sonarqube\n</code></pre>\n<p>Execute the following script to start the server:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On Linux/Mac OS: bin/<YOUR OS>/sonar.sh start</li>\n<li>On Windows: bin/windows-x86-XX/StartSonar.bat</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can now browse SonarQube at <em><a href=\"http://localhost:9000\">http://localhost:9000</a></em> (the default System administrator credentials are <code>admin</code>/<code>admin</code>).</p>\n<h3>Tuning the Web Server</h3>\n<p>By default, SonarQube is configured to run on any computer with a simple Java JRE.</p>\n<p>For better performance, the first thing to do when installing a production instance is to use a Java JDK and activate the server mode by uncommenting/setting the following line in <em>$SONARQUBE-HOME/conf/sonar.properties</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>sonar.web.javaOpts=-server\n</code></pre>\n<p>To change the Java JVM used by SonarQube, simply edit <em>$SONARQUBE-HOME/conf/wrapper.conf</em> and update the following line:</p>\n<pre><code>wrapper.java.command=/path/to/my/jdk/bin/java\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Advanced Installation Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Running SonarQube as a Service on <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/setup/operate-server/\">Windows</a> or <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/setup/operate-server/\">Linux</a></li>\n<li>Running SonarQube <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/setup/operate-server/\">behind a Proxy</a></li>\n<li>Running SonarQube Community Edition with <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/sonarqube/\">Docker</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Once your server is installed and running, you may also want to <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/setup/install-plugin/\">Install Plugins</a>.

This can be done for security concerns or to consolidate multiple disparate applications.</p>\n<h3>Server Configuration</h3>\n<p>To run the SonarQube server over HTTPS, you must build a standard reverse proxy infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The reverse proxy must be configured to set the value <code>X_FORWARDED_PROTO: https</code> in each HTTP request header. Without this property, redirection initiated by the SonarQube server will fall back on HTTP.</p>\n<h3>Using an Apache Proxy</h3>\n<p>We assume that you've already installed Apache 2 with module mod<em>proxy, that SonarQube is running and available on `<a href=\"http://private\">http://private</a></em>sonar<em>host:sonar</em>port/<code>and that you want to configure a Virtual Host for</code>www.public_sonar.com`.</p>\n<p>At this point, edit the HTTPd configuration file for the <code>www.public_sonar.com</code> virtual host. Include the following to expose SonarQube via <code>mod_proxy</code> at <code>http://www.public_sonar.com/</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>ProxyRequests Off\nProxyPreserveHost On\n&#x3C;VirtualHost *:80>\n  ServerName www.public_sonar.com\n  ServerAdmin admin@somecompany.com\n  ProxyPass / http://private_sonar_host:sonar_port/\n  ProxyPassReverse / http://www.public_sonar.com/\n  ErrorLog logs/somecompany/sonar/error.log\n  CustomLog logs/somecompany/sonar/access.log common\n&#x3C;/VirtualHost>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Apache configuration is going to vary based on your own application's requirements and the way you intend to expose SonarQube to the outside world. If you need more details about Apache HTTPd and mod_proxy, please see <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org\">http://httpd.apache.org</a>.</p>\n<h3>Using Nginx</h3>\n<p>We assume that you've already installed Nginx, that you are using a Virtual Host for www.somecompany.com and that SonarQube is running and available on <code>http://sonarhost:sonarport/</code>.</p>\n<p>At this point, edit the Nginx configuration file.

You'll find them in <code>$SONARQUBE_HOME/logs</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sonar.log - Log for the main process. Holds general information about startup and shutdown. You'll get overall status here but not details. Look to the other logs for that.</li>\n<li>web.log - Information about initial connection to the database, database migration and reindexing, and the processing of HTTP requests. This includes database and search engine logs related to those requests.</li>\n<li>ce.log - Information about background task processing and the database and search engine logs related to those tasks.</li>\n<li>es.log - Ops information from the search engine, such as Elasticsearch startup, health status changes, cluster-, node- and index-level operations, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Understanding the logs</h2>\n<p>When there's an error, you'll very often find a stacktrace in the logs. If you're not familiar stacktraces, they can be intimidatingly tall walls of incomprehensible text. As a sample, here's a fairly short one:</p>\n<pre><code>java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to blame file **/**/foo.java\n    at org.sonarsource.scm.git.JGitBlameCommand.blame(JGitBlameCommand.java:128)\n    at org.sonarsource.scm.git.JGitBlameCommand.access$000(JGitBlameCommand.java:44)\n    at org.sonarsource.scm.git.JGitBlameCommand$1.call(JGitBlameCommand.java:112)\n    at org.sonarsource.scm.git.JGitBlameCommand$1.call(JGitBlameCommand.java:109)\n    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(Unknown Source)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(Unknown Source)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.eclipse.jgit.treewalk.filter.PathFilter.create(PathFilter.java:77)\n    at org.eclipse.jgit.blame.BlameGenerator.&#x3C;init>(BlameGenerator.java:161)\n    at org.eclipse.jgit.api.BlameCommand.call(BlameCommand.java:203)\n    at org.sonarsource.scm.git.JGitBlameCommand.blame(JGitBlameCommand.java:126)\n    ... 7 more\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unless you wrote the code that produced this error, you really only care about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the first line, which ought to have a human-readable message after the colon.

Very often one of them - the last one or next to last one - contains the real problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recovering from Elasticsearch read-only indices</h2>\n<p>You may encounter issues with Elasticsearch (ES) indices becoming locked in read-only mode. ES requires free disk space available and implements a safety mechanism to prevent the disk from being flooded with index data that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For non-DCE</strong> –  locks all indices in read-only mode when the 95% used disk usage watermark is reached.  </li>\n<li><strong>For DCE</strong> – locks all or some indices in read-only mode when one or more node reaches the 95% used disk usage watermark.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ES shows warnings in the logs as soon as disk usage reaches 85% and 90%. At 95% usage and above, indices turning read-only causes errors in the web and compute engine.</p>\n<p>Freeing disk space will <em>not</em> automatically make the indices return to read-write. To make indices read-write, you also need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For non-DCE</strong> – restart SonarQube.</li>\n<li><strong>For DCE</strong> – restart <em>ALL</em> application nodes (the first application node restarted after all have been stopped will make the indices read-write).  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>SonarQube's built-in resilience mechanism allows SonarQube to eventually recover from the indices being behind data in the DB (this process can take a while).</p>\n<p>If you still have inconsistencies, you'll need to rebuild the indices (this operation can take a long time depending on the number of issues and components):</p>\n<p><strong>non-DCE:</strong>  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stop SonarQube  </li>\n<li>Delete the data/es6 directory  </li>\n<li>Restart SonarQube  </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>DCE:</strong>  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Stop the whole cluster (ES and application nodes)  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete the data/es6 directory on each ES node  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restart the whole cluster  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> See <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/setup/operate-cluster/\">Configure &#x26; Operate a Cluster</a> for information on stopping and starting a cluster.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/setup/troubleshooting/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h2>Release 8.2 Upgrade Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>PostgreSQL 12.1 support</strong><br>\nSonarQube 8.2+ now support PostgreSQL 9.3 - 12.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jira.sonarsource.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10930&#x26;version=15301\">Full Release Notes</a></p>\n<h2>Release 8.1 Upgrade Notes</h2>\n<p><strong>Short-lived and Long-lived branches are now just branches</strong><br>\nThe concept for branches is now simplified, with a single way to handle all of them.

On Oracle, the database columns to be dropped are now marked as UNUSED and are not physically dropped anymore. To reclaim disk space, Oracle administrators must drop these unused columns manually. The SQL request is <code>ALTER TABLE foo DROP UNUSED COLUMNS</code>. The relevant tables are listed in the system table <code>all_unused_col_tabs</code>.</p>\n<h3>Additional Database Maintenance</h3>\n<p>Refreshing your database's statistics and rebuilding your database's indices are recommended once the technical upgrade is done (just before the very last step).</p>\n<p>For PostgreSQL, that means executing <code>VACUUM FULL</code>. According to the PostgreSQL documentation:</p>\n<pre><code>In normal PostgreSQL operation, tuples that are deleted or obsoleted by an update are not physically removed from their table; they remain present until a VACUUM is done.\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Scanner Update</h3>\n<p>When upgrading SonarQube, you should also make sure you’re using the latest versions of the SonarQube scanners to take advantage of features and fixes on the scanner side. Please check the documentation pages of the Scanners you use for the most recent version compatible with SonarQube and your build tools.</p>\n<h3>SonarQube as a Linux or Windows Service</h3>\n<p>If you use external configuration, such as a script or Windows Service to control your server, you'll need to update it to point to <code>$NEW_SONARQUBE_HOME</code>.</p>\n<p>In case you used the InstallNTService.bat to install SonarQube as a Windows Service, run the $OLD<em>SONARQUBE</em>HOME/bin/.../UninstallNTService.bat before running the InstallNTService.bat of the $NEW<em>SONARQUBE</em>HOME.</p>\n<h2>Release Upgrade Notes</h2>\n<p>Usually SonarQube releases come with some specific recommendations for upgrading from the previous version.

Assume you have a set of projects which has been split for technical reasons, but which shares a lifecycle; they interact directly in production and are always released together. With an Application, they can be treated as a single entity in SonarQube with a unified Project Homepage, Issues list, Measures space, and most importantly: Quality Gate.</p>\n<h3>Applications vs. Portfolios</h3>\n<p>Applications and Portfolios are both aggregations of projects, but they have different goals and therefore different presentations. A Portfolio is designed to be a very high-level, executive overview that shows how a package of projects that may only be tangentially related are doing quality-wise, and what the trends are. Applications allow you to see your set of projects as a larger, overall meta-project. For instance, because all the projects in an application ship together, if one of them isn't releasable then none of them are, and an Application's consolidated Quality Gate gives you an immediate summary of what must be fixed across all projects in order to allow you to release the set.</p>\n<h2>Application Setup</h2>\n<p>Applications are created and edited in the global Portfolio administration interface: <strong>Administration > Configuration > Portfolios</strong>. For more, see <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/project-administration/configuring-portfolios-and-applications/\">Configuring Portfolios and Applications</a>. Applications must be created initially by a user with global administration rights, but after set-up, administration of an individual Application can be delegated to other users.</p>\n<h3>Populating Application Data</h3>\n<p>An Application is automatically re-calculated after each analysis of one of its projects. If you want immediate (re)calculation, a user with administration rights on the Application can use the <strong>Recompute</strong> button in the Application-level <strong>Administration > Edit Definition</strong> interface. The global Portfolio administration interface: <strong>Administration > Configuration > Portfolios</strong> offers the ability to queue re-computation of all Applications and Portfolios at once.</p>\n<h2>Applications and Branch Analysis</h2>\n<p>Branches are available for Applications. They allow you to aggregate branches from the projects in an Application.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Avoid adding branches to your application that will be deleted to prevent issues with your Application status.</p>\n<p>Once an Application has been set up, anyone with administration rights on the Application can manually create a new branch in the <strong>Administration > Edit Definition</strong> interface. Branches can also be managed from the global <strong>Administration > Configuration > Portfolios</strong> interface. For each Application branch you can choose which project branch should be included, or whether the project should be represented in the branch at all.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/user-guide/applications/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Tags are a way to categorize rules and issues.

As a developer, you focus on maintaining high standards and taking responsibility specifically in the New Code you're working on. SonarQube gives you the tools that let you set high standards and take pride in knowing that your code meets those standards.</p>\n<h2>Focus on New Code</h2>\n<p>With Clean as You Code, your focus is always on New Code (code that has been added or changed in your New Code Period) and making sure the code you write today is clean and safe. </p>\n<p>The New Code Period can be set at different levels (global, project, and with <a href=\"https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/developer.html\">Developer Edition</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sonarsource.com/plans-and-pricing/\">above</a> at the branch level). Depending on the level at which your New Code Period is set, you can change the starting point of your New Code Period to fit your situation.</p>\n<p>For more information on the New Code Period and setting it, check out <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/project-administration/new-code-period/\">Setting Your New Code Period</a>.</p>\n<h2>Personal Responsibility</h2>\n<p>With Clean as You Code, you aren't responsible for anyone else's code. You own the quality and security of the New Code you are working on today. If you add new issues, SonarQube automatically assigns them to you so you can maintain quality in your code.</p>\n<p>For more information on issues and how they are assigned, check out the <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/user-guide/issues/\">Issues</a> documentation.</p>\n<h2>Quality Gate</h2>\n<p>Your Quality Gate is a set of conditions that tells you whether or not your project is ready for release. With the Clean as You Code approach, your Quality Gate should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focus on New Code metrics</strong> – When your Quality Gate is set to focus on New Code metrics (like the built-in Sonar way Quality Gate), new features will be delivered cleanly. As long as your Quality gate is green, your releases will continue to improve.</li>\n<li><strong>Set and enforce high standards</strong> – When standards are set and enforced on New Code, you aren't worried about having to meet those standards in old code and having to clean up someone else's code. You can take pride in meeting high standards on <em>your</em> code.

The set of coding rules is defined through the associated <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/instance-administration/quality-profiles/\">quality profile</a> for each language in the project. </p>\n<h3>Issue Types</h3>\n<p>There are three types of issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bug</strong> – A coding error that will break your code and needs to be fixed immediately.</li>\n<li><strong>Vulnerability</strong> – A point in your code that's open to attack.</li>\n<li><strong>Code Smell</strong> – A maintainability issue that makes your code confusing and difficult to maintain.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Issue Severity</h3>\n<p>Each issue has one of five severities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>BLOCKER</strong><br>\nBug with a high probability to impact the behavior of the application in production: memory leak, unclosed JDBC connection, .... The code MUST be immediately fixed.</li>\n<li><strong>CRITICAL</strong><br>\nEither a bug with a low probability to impact the behavior of the application in production or an issue which represents a security flaw: empty catch block, SQL injection, ... The code MUST be immediately reviewed. </li>\n<li><strong>MAJOR</strong><br>\nQuality flaw which can highly impact the developer productivity: uncovered piece of code, duplicated blocks, unused parameters, ...</li>\n<li><strong>MINOR</strong><br>\nQuality flaw which can slightly impact the developer productivity: lines should not be too long, \"switch\" statements should have at least 3 cases, ...</li>\n<li><strong>INFO</strong><br>\nNeither a bug nor a quality flaw, just a finding.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ideally, the team wouldn't introduce any new issues (any new technical debt). <a href=\"https://sonarlint.org\">SonarLint</a> can help developers because it provides the ability to perform local analyses to check their code before pushing it back to the SCM. But in real life, it's not always possible to code without any new technical debt, and sometimes it's not worth it.</p>\n<p>So new issues get introduced.</p>\n<h2>Understanding issue context</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, issues are self-evident once they're pointed out. For instance, if your team has agreed to a init-lower, camelCase variable naming convention, and an issue is raised on <code>My_variable</code>, you don't need a lot of context to understand the problem. But in other situations context may be essential to understanding why an issue was raised. That's why SonarQube supports not just the primary issue location, where the issue message is shown, but also secondary issue locations. For instance, secondary issues locations are used to mark the pieces of code in a method which add Cognitive Complexity to a method. </p>\n<p>But there are times when a simple laundry list of contributing locations isn't enough to understand an issue. For instance, when a null pointer can be dereferenced on some paths through the code, what you really need are issue flows. Each flow is a <em>set</em> of secondary locations ordered to show the exact path through the code on which a problem can happen. And because there can be multiple paths through the code on which, for instance a resource is not released, SonarQube supports multiple flows.</p>\n<h2>Issues lifecycle</h2>\n<h3>Statuses</h3>\n<p>After creation, issues flow through a lifecycle, taking one of five possible statuses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Open</strong> - set by SonarQube on new issues</li>\n<li><strong>Confirmed</strong> - set manually to indicate that the issue is valid</li>\n<li><strong>Resolved</strong> - set manually to indicate that the next analysis should Close the issue</li>\n<li><strong>Reopened</strong> - set automatically by SonarQube when a Resolved issue hasn't actually been corrected</li>\n<li><strong>Closed</strong> - set automatically by SonarQube for automatically created issues. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Resolutions</h3>\n<p>Closed issues will have one of two resolutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed</strong> - set automatically when a subsequent analysis shows that the issue has been corrected or the file is no longer available (removed from the project, excluded or renamed)</li>\n<li><strong>Removed</strong> - set automatically when the related rule is no longer available. The rule may not be available either because it has been removed from the Quality Profile or because the underlying plugin has been uninstalled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Resolved issues will have one of two resolutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>False Positive</strong> - set manually</li>\n<li><strong>Won't Fix</strong> - set manually</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Issue Workflow</h3>\n<p>Issues are automatically closed (status: Closed) when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an issue (of any status) has been properly fixed => Resolution: Fixed</li>\n<li>an issue no longer exists because the related coding rule has been deactived or is no longer available (ie: plugin has been removed) => Resolution: Removed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Issues are automatically reopened (status: Reopened) when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an issue that was manually Resolved as Fixed(but Resolution is not False positive) is shown by a subsequent analysis to still exist</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Understanding which Issues are \"New\"</h2>\n<p>To determine the creation date of an issue, an algorithm is executed during each analysis to determine whether an issue is new or existed previously. This algorithm relies on content hashes (excluding whitespace) for the line the issue is reported on. For multi-line issues, the hash of the first line is used. For each file (after detection of file renaming), the algorithm takes the base list of issues from the previous analysis, and tries to match those issues with the raw issue list reported by the new analysis. The algorithm tries to first match using the strongest evidence, and then falls back to weaker heuristics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the issue is on the same rule, with the same line number and with the same line hash (but not necessarily with the same message) > MATCH</li>\n<li>detect block move inside file, then if the issue is on the same (moved) line and on the same rule (but not necessarily with the same message) > MATCH</li>\n<li>on the same rule, with the same message and with the same line hash (but not necessarily with the same line) > MATCH</li>\n<li>on the same rule, with the same message and with the same line number (but not necessarily with the same line hash) > MATCH</li>\n<li>on the same rule and with the same line hash (but not the same message and not the same line) > MATCH</li>\n<li>is there a matching <strong>CLOSED</strong> issue > MATCH and Reopen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unmatched \"base\" issues are closed as fixed.</p>\n<p>Unmatched \"raw\" issues are new.</p>\n<h2>Understanding Issue Backdating</h2>\n<p>Once an issue has been determied to be \"new\", as described above, the next question is what date to give it. For instance, what if it has existed in code for a long time, but only found in the most recent analysis because new rules were added to the profile? Should this issue be given the date of the last change on its line, or the date of the analysis where it was first raised? That is, should it be backdated? If the date of the last change to the line is available (this requires <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/scm-integration/\">SCM integration</a>) then under certain circumstances, the issue will be backdated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On first analysis of a project or branch</li>\n<li>When the rule is new in the profile (a brand new rule activated or a rule that was deactivated and is now activated)</li>\n<li>When the analyzer has just been upgraded (because rule implementations could be smarter now)</li>\n<li>When the rule is external</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a consequence, it is possible that backdating will keep newly raised issues out of the New Code Period.</p>\n<h2>Automatic Issue Assignment</h2>\n<h3>For Bug, Vulnerability and Code Smell</h3>\n<p>New issues are automatically assigned during analysis to the last committer on the issue line if the committer can be correlated to a SonarQube user. Note that currently, issues on any level above a file, e.g. directory / project, cannot be automatically assigned.</p>\n<h3>User Correlation</h3>\n<p>Login and email correlations are made automatically. I.e. if the user commits with her email address and that email address is part of her SonarQube profile, then new issues raised on lines where she was the last committer will be automatically assigned to her.</p>\n<p>Additional correlations can be made manually in the user's profile (see \"SCM accounts\" in Authorization for more).</p>\n<h3>Known Limitation</h3>\n<p>If the SCM login associated with an issue is longer than 255 characters allowed for an issue author, the author will be left blank.</p>\n<h2>Issue edits</h2>\n<p>SonarQube's issues workflow can help you manage your issues. There are seven different things you can do to an issue (other than fixing it in the code!): Comment, Assign, Confirm, Change Severity, Resolve, Won't Fix, and False Positive.</p>\n<p>These actions break out into three different categories. First up is the \"technical review\" category.</p>\n<h3>Technical Review</h3>\n<p>The Confirm, False Positive, Won't Fix, Severity change, and Resolve actions all fall into this category, which presumes an initial review of an issue to verify its validity. Assume it's time to review the technical debt added in the last review period - whether that's a day, a week, or an entire sprint. You go through each new issue and do one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Confirm</strong> - By confirming an issue, you're basically saying \"Yep, that's a problem.\" Doing so moves it out of \"Open\" status to \"Confirmed\".</li>\n<li><strong>False Positive</strong> - Looking at the issue in context, you realize that for whatever reason, this issue isn't actually a problem. So you mark it False Positive and move on. Requires Administer Issues permission on the project.</li>\n<li><strong>Won't Fix</strong> - Looking at the issue in context, you realize that while it's a valid issue it's not one that actually needs fixing. In other words, it represents accepted technical debt. So you mark it Won't Fix and move on. Requires Administer Issues permission on the project.</li>\n<li><strong>Severity change</strong> - This is the middle ground between the first two options. Yes, it's a problem, but it's not as bad a problem as the rule's default severity makes it out to be. Or perhaps it's actually far worse. Either way, you adjust the severity of the issue to bring it in line with what you feel it deserves.  Requires Administer Issues permission on the project.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolve</strong> - If you think you've fixed an open issue, you can Resolve it. If you're right, the next analysis will move it to closed status. If you're wrong, its status will go to re-opened.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you tend to mark a lot of issues False Positive or Won't Fix, it means that some coding rules are not appropriate for your context. So, you can either completely deactivate them in the quality profile or use issue exclusions to narrow the focus of the rules so they are not used on specific parts (or types of object) of your application. Similarly, making a lot of severity changes should prompt you to consider updating the rule severities in your profiles.</p>\n<p>As you edit issues, the related metrics (e.g. New Bugs), will update automatically, as will the Quality Gate status if it's relevant.</p>\n<h3>Dispositioning</h3>\n<p>Once issues have been through technical review, it's time to decide who's going to deal them. By default they're assigned to the last committer on the issue line (at the time the issue is raised), but you can certainly reassign them to yourself or someone else. The assignee will receive email notification of the assignment if he signed up for notifications, and the assignment will show up everywhere the issue is displayed, including in the My Issues list in the My Account space.</p>\n<h3>General</h3>\n<p>At any time during the lifecycle of an issue, you can log a comment on it. Comments are displayed in the issue detail in a running log. You have the ability to edit or delete the comments you made.</p>\n<p>You can also edit an issue's tags. Issues inherit the tags of the rules that created them, but the tag set on an issue is fully editable. Tags can be created, added and removed at will for users with the Browse permission on the project.</p>\n<p>Although they are initially inherited from the relevant rule, the tags on an issue are not synchronized with the rule, so adding tags to a rule will not add those tags to the rule's issues. </p>\n<h3>Bulk Change</h3>\n<p>All of these changes and more can be made to multiple issues at once using the Bulk Change option in the issues search results pane.</p>\n<h2>Purging Closed Issues</h2>\n<p>By default, Closed issues are kept for 30 days.

If the project passes, a simple, green all-clear is shown.</p>\n<p>If not, details and drill-downs are immediately available to quickly identify what went wrong, with a section for each error condition showing what the current project value is and what it should be. As usual, you'll be able to click through on current values to get to drilldowns.</p>\n<h2>What should I fix first?</h2>\n<p>Because the best way to improve a project's quality is to catch and fix new problems before they become entrenched, the first view of a project is centered around the New Code Period, which is highlighted in yellow on the right of the project homepage. The project space page shows a high-level summary of critical metrics, both current values and their New Code Period values.</p>\n<p>Just below the Quality Gate information, you have the numbers of old and new Issues in the Reliability and Security domains and then the Maintainability domain. Clicking on any figure on the page will take you to a detailed view, either in the Measures Page or the Issues Page.</p>\n<p>The most important thing a developer must do is to ensure the new Issues in the yellow part of the screen are acknowledged, reviewed and fixed and to make sure that new code is covered by tests to help prevent future regressions. Regardless of how many Issues were introduced in the past or how little test coverage there is overall, a focus on the newly added Issues will ensure that the situation won't degrade versus the version you previously released in production.</p>\n<p>So, which issues should you go after first: Bugs, Vulnerabilities or Code Smells? It depends, because the answer is dependent on the nature of your Issues. Let's say you have issues for a block of code that is duplicated 5 times, and inside this duplicated block of code, you have 3 Bugs and 5 Security Issues. The best approach is probably to fix the duplication first and then resolve the Bugs and Vulnerabilities in the newly centralized location, rather than fixing them 5 times.</p>\n<p>That's why you need to review your new Issues before jumping into resolving them. </p>\n<h2>How can I ...</h2>\n<h3>How can I see project measures at a lower level?</h3>\n<p>The project-level <strong>Measures</strong> menu item takes you to a dedicated sub-space where you see all project measures. Choose a measure for more details. Both list and tree views are available for each measure, and treemaps are available for percentages and ratings.</p>\n<h3>How can I see all the issues in a project?</h3>\n<p>The project-level <strong>Issues</strong> menu item takes you to a project-specific Issues page, where you can perform all the same actions you can at the higher level.\nOn this page, you can easily narrow the list to the New Issues introduced during the New Code Period, by selecting <code>New Code</code> in <strong>Creation Date</strong> facet.</p>\n<h3>How can I see the project structure and code?</h3>\n<p>The project-level <strong>Code</strong> menu item takes you to an outline of your project structure. Drill down to see files in a directory, and choose a file to see its code.</p>\n<p>If your project is too large for easy exploration via drilling, the search feature on this page will help. While the global search in the main menu returns results from throughout the SonarQube instance, the localized search on the code page is restricted to files and directories in the current project.</p>\n<h3>How can I see the project activity / history?</h3>\n<p>The project-level <strong>Activity</strong> menu item takes you to the full list of code scans performed on your project since it was created in SonarQube. By going there you can follow the evolution of the Quality Gate, see the changes of Quality Profiles and know when a given version of your code has been scanned.</p>\n<h3>How can I easily spot the risks in a project?</h3>\n<p>Visualizations allow you to compare project components and quickly spot the ones that represent the greatest risks. The <strong>Activity</strong> page offers several pre-defined visualizations, and you can also create Custom visualizations with the metrics of your choice.</p>\n<h3>How can I promote the health of my project to peers ?</h3>\n<p>If your project is publicly visible, then you can further promote its status in external tools and websites using native Project Badges. The <strong>Get project badges</strong> button on the homepage of a public project lets you choose/fine-tune your badge and gives you the URL for it.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/user-guide/project-page/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>A quality gate is the best way to enforce a quality policy in your organization.\nIt's there to answer ONE question: can I deliver my project to production today or not?</p>\n<p>In order to answer this question, you define a set of Boolean conditions based on measure thresholds against which projects are measured. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No new blocker issues</li>\n<li>Code coverage on new code greater than 80%</li>\n<li>Etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ideally, all projects will be verified against the same quality gate, but that's not always practical. For instance, you may find that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technological implementation differs from one application to another (you might not require the same code coverage on new code for Web or Java applications).</li>\n<li>You want to ensure stronger requirements on some of your applications (internal frameworks for example).</li>\n<li>Etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which is why you can define as many quality gates as you wish. Quality Gates are defined and managed in the <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube#/quality_gates\">Quality Gates</a></strong> page found in the top menu.</p>\n<h2>Use the Best Quality Gate Configuration</h2>\n<p>The quality gate \"Sonar way\" is provided by SonarSource, activated by default and considered as built-in and so read-only. It represents our view of the best way to implement the <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/user-guide/clean-as-you-code/\">Clean as You Code</a> concept. At each SonarQube release, we adjust automatically this default quality gate according to SonarQube's capabilities.</p>\n<p>Three metrics allow you to enforce a given Rating of Reliability, Security and Maintainability, not just overall but also on new code. These metrics are recommended and come as part of the default quality gate. We strongly advise you to adjust your own quality gates to use them to make feedback more clear to your developers looking at their quality gate on their project page.</p>\n<p>Don't forget also that quality gate conditions must use differential values. There is no point for example to check an absolute value such as : Number of Lines of Code is greater than 1000.</p>\n<h3>Recommended Quality Gate</h3>\n<p>The <code>Sonar way</code> Built-in quality gate is recommended for most projects. If focuses on keeping new code clean, rather than spending a lot of effort remediating old code. Out of the box, it's already set as the default profile.</p>\n<h2>Quality Gate Status</h2>\n<p>The current status is displayed prominently at the top of the Project Page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/quality-gate-status.jpeg\" alt=\"Quality Gate Status\"></p>\n<h2>Getting Notified When a Quality Gate Fails</h2>\n<p>Thanks to the notification mechanism, users can be notified when a quality gate fails. To do so, subscribe to the <strong>New quality gate status</strong> notification either for all projects or a set of projects you're interested in.</p>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<p>Quality Gates can be accessed by any user (even anonymous users). All users can view every aspect of a quality gate.</p>\n<p>To make changes (create, edit or delete) users must be granted the <strong>Administer Quality Profiles and Gates</strong> permission.</p>\n<p>A <strong>project administrator</strong> can choose which quality gates his/her project is associated with.

Instead, its status is set to \"REMOVED\". This allows current or old issues related to this rule to be displayed properly in SonarQube until they are fully removed.</p>\n<h2>Extending Coding Rules</h2>\n<p>Custom coding rules can be added. See <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/extend/adding-coding-rules/\">Adding Coding Rules</a> for detailed information and tutorials.</p>\n<h2>Rule Types and Severities</h2>\n<h3>How are rules categorized?</h3>\n<p>The SonarQube Quality Model divides rules into four categories: Bugs, Vulnerabilities, Security Hotspots, and Code Smells. Rules are assigned to categories based on the answers to these questions:</p>\n<p><strong>Is the rule about code that is demonstrably wrong, or more likely wrong than not?</strong><br>\nIf the answer is \"yes\", then it's a Bug rule.<br>\nIf not...</p>\n<p><strong>Is the rule about code that could be exploited by a hacker?</strong><br>\nIf so, then it's a Vulnerability rule.<br>\nIf not...</p>\n<p><strong>Is the rule about code that is security-sensitive?</strong><br>\nIf so, then it's a Security Hotspot rule.<br>\nIf not...</p>\n<p><strong>Is the rule neither a Bug nor a Vulnerability?</strong><br>\nIf so, then it's a Code Smell rule.</p>\n<h2>How are severities assigned?</h2>\n<p>To assign severity to a rule, we ask a further series of questions. The first one is basically:</p>\n<p><strong>What's the worst thing that could happen?</strong></p>\n<p>In answering this question, we try to factor in Murphy's Law without predicting Armageddon.</p>\n<p>Then we assess whether the impact and likelihood of the Worst Thing (see <em>How are severity and likelihood decided?</em>, below) are high or low, and plug the answers into a truth table:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Impact</th>\n<th>Likelihood</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Blocker</td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/check.svg\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/check.svg\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Critical</td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/check.svg\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/cross.svg\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Major</td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/cross.svg\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/check.svg\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minor</td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/cross.svg\"></td>\n<td><img src=\"/images/cross.svg\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>How are severity and likelihood decided?</h2>\n<p>To assess the severity of a rule, we start from the Worst Thing (see <em>How are severities assigned?</em>, above) and ask category-specific questions.</p>\n<h3>Bugs</h3>\n<p>Impact: <strong>Could the Worst Thing cause the application to crash or to corrupt stored data?</strong></p>\n<p>Likelihood: <strong>What's the probability that the Worst Thing will happen?</strong></p>\n<h3>Vulnerabilities</h3>\n<p>Impact: <strong>Could the exploitation of the Worst Thing result in significant damage to your assets or your users?</strong></p>\n<p>Likelihood: <strong>What is the probability that a hacker will be able to exploit the Worst Thing?</strong></p>\n<h3>Security Hotspots</h3>\n<p>Security Hotspots are not assigned severities as it is unknown whether there is truly an underlying vulnerability until they are reviewed.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/user-guide/rules/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h2>What is a Security Hotspot?</h2>\n<p>Security Hotspots highlight security-sensitive pieces of code that need to be manually reviewed. Upon review, you'll either find that there is no threat or that there is vulnerable code that needs to be fixed. </p>\n<h2>Why are Security Hotspots Important?</h2>\n<p>Security Hotspots help you focus your efforts as you manually checking security-sensitive code. Reviewing Security Hotspots allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Detect security issues</strong> – You can detect vulnerable code and ensure issues are fixed before merging pull requests or releasing your branch.</li>\n<li><strong>Learn about security</strong> – You can see why your code was identified as a Security Hotspot and the link between your Security Hotspots and well-known attacks or weaknesses such as SQL Injection, Weak Cryptography, or Authentication. This helps you to know when you're working on security-sensitive code and to avoid creating vulnerable code.</li>\n<li><strong>Learn how to fix vulnerable code</strong> – From the Security Hotspots page, you can see why the Hotspot was raised, determine if you've used code in a security-sensitive way, and learn how to fix it if you have.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lifecycle</h2>\n<p>Security Hotspots have a dedicated lifecycle. To make status changes, the user needs the <strong>Administer Security Hotspots</strong> permission. This permission is enabled by default. Users with the <strong>Browse</strong> permission can comment on or change the user assigned to a Security Hotspot.</p>\n<h3>Statuses</h3>\n<p>Through the lifecycle, a Security Hotspot takes one of the following statuses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>To Review</strong> – the default status of new Security Hotspots set by SonarQube. A Security Hotspot has been reported and needs to be checked.</li>\n<li><strong>Reviewed</strong> – a developer has manually assessed the Security Hotspot and either considered the code not vulnerable or any vulnerability issue that was found has been fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A Security Hotspot is only closed if the code containing it is deleted or the rule is deactivated.</p>\n<h2>Workflow</h2>\n<p>Follow this workflow to review Security Hotspots and fix any vulnerable code that you find.</p>\n<h3>Review Priority</h3>\n<p>When SonarQube detects a Security Hotspot, it's added to the list of Security Hotspots according to its review priority from High to Low. Hotspots with a High Review Priority are the most likely to contain vulnerable code and need your attention first. </p>\n<p>Review Priority is determined by the security category of each security rule. Rules in categories that are ranked high on the OWASP Top 10 and CWE Top 25 standards are considered to have a High Review Priority. Rules in categories that aren't ranked high or aren't mentioned on the OWASP Top 10 or CWE Top 25 standards are rated as Medium or Low.</p>\n<h3>Reviewing Hotspots</h3>\n<p>When reviewing a Hotspot, you should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Review the <strong>What's the risk</strong> tab to understand why the Security Hotspot was raised.</li>\n<li>From the <strong>Are you vulnerable</strong> tab, read the <strong>Ask Yourself Whether</strong> section to determine if the code is used in a security-sensitive way.</li>\n<li>From the <strong>How can you fix it</strong> tab, follow the <strong>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</strong> to fix your code if you've determined it's unsafe.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After following these steps, set the Security Hotspot to one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed</strong> – if you found vulnerable code and have modified it to follow secure coding practices.</li>\n<li><strong>Safe</strong> – if the code already follows secure coding practices and doesn't need to be modified.</li>\n<li><strong>Needs additional review</strong> – if you need another user's review to make sure the Security Hotspot doesn't contain vulnerable code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Review History</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Review history</strong> tab shows the history of the Security Hotspot including the status it's been assigned and any comments the reviewer had regarding the Hotspot.  </p>","fields":{"slug":"/user-guide/security-hotspots/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><em>Security Reports are available as part of the <a href=\"https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/enterprise.html\">Enterprise Edition</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sonarsource.com/plans-and-pricing/\">above</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>What do Security Reports show?</h2>\n<p>Security Reports quickly give you the big picture on your application's security, with breakdowns of just where you stand in regard to each of the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_Top_10\">OWASP Top 10</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors\">SANS Top 25</a> categories, and <a href=\"http://cwe.mitre.org/\">CWE</a>-specific details.</p>\n<p>The Security Reports are fed by the analyzers, which rely on the rules activated in your quality profiles to raise security issues. If there are no rules corresponding to a given OWASP category activated in your Quality Profile, you will get no issues linked to that specific category and the rating displayed will be A. That won't mean you are safe for that category, but that you need to activate more rules (assuming some exist).</p>\n<h2>What's the difference between a Security Hotspot and a Vulnerability?</h2>\n<p>Vulnerabilities are points in the code which are open to attack. Security Hotspots highlight security-sensitive pieces of code that need to be manually reviewed to ensure the sensitive piece of code is being used in the safest manner. Security hotspots also help educate developers on security issues. </p>\n<p>For more details, see <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/user-guide/security-hotspots/\">Security Hotspots</a></p>\n<h2>Why are some Security Hotspot and Vulnerability rules very similar?</h2>\n<p>They are overlapping on purpose. The Security Hotspot rule is supposed to include all matches of the Vulnerability rules, and cases where the taint analysis engine is not able to detect vulnerabilities. For example, switching from one language to another (XML, JNI, etc...) or using some third party libraries will prevent the taint analysis from finding vulnerabilities. A Vulnerability rule highlights security threats only when it has a high level of confidence, which means that it will always miss some of them. Whereas a Security Hotspot rule guides secure code reviews by showing code where those issues might lurk, even if it could not detect any vulnerability.</p>\n<h2>Why don't I see any Vulnerabilities or Security Hotspots?</h2>\n<p>You might not see any Vulnerabilities or Security Hotspots for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don't have any because the code has been written without using any security-sensitive API. </li>\n<li>Vulnerability or Security Hotspot rules are available but not activated in your Quality Profile so no Security Hotspots or Vulnerabilities are raised.</li>\n<li>The analyzer for your language might only currently offer a few rules and won't raise any or only a small number of Vulnerabilities or Security Hotspots.</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/user-guide/security-reports/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>The SonarQube Quality Model has three different types of rules: Reliability (bug), Vulnerability (security), and Maintainability (code smell) rules. But divided another way, there are only two types: security rules, and all the rest. The distinction between these two groups is not so much in what they catch but in where they come from and in the standards imposed on them.</p>\n<h2>What to expect from security-related rules</h2>\n<p>To be clear, the standard for most rules implemented in SonarQube language plugins is very strict: no false positives. For normal rules, you should be able to be confident that whatever is reported to you as an issue really is an issue.</p>\n<p>But for security-related rules, the story is a little different. For instance, a lot of security guidelines talk about how \"sensitive\" data should be handled (e.g. not logged, not stored un-encrypted, &#x26;etc.). But since it's not really possible in a rule to tell which data is sensitive and which isn't, the choice becomes: maintain the no-false-positives standard and don't implement security-related rules, or implement security-related rules with a different standard.</p>\n<p>That's why security-related rules cast a wider net than you may be used to seeing. The idea is that the rule will flag anything suspicious, and leave it to the human security auditor to cull the false positives and sent the real issues for remediation.</p>\n<p>Security Hotspots are a special type of issue that identify sensitive areas of code that need to be reviewed to determine if they contain vulnerable code.  See <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/user-guide/security-hotspots/\">Security Hotspots</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Where security-related rules come from</h2>\n<p>The vast majority of security-related rules originate from established standards: <a href=\"http://cwe.mitre.org/\">CWE</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors/\">SANS Top 25</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_Top_10\">OWASP Top 10</a>. To find rules that relate to any of these standards, you can search rules either by tag or by text. The standards that a rule relates to will be listed in the <strong>See</strong> section at the bottom of the rule description. </p>\n<h3>CWE</h3>\n<p>CWE stands for Common Weakness Enumeration. According to the <a href=\"http://cwe.mitre.org/about/faq.html#A.1\">CWE FAQ</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™) is a formal list or dictionary of common software weaknesses that can occur in software's architecture, design, code or implementation that can lead to exploitable security vulnerabilities. CWE was created to serve as a common language for describing software security weaknesses; serve as a standard measuring stick for software security tools targeting these weaknesses; and to provide a common baseline standard for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The CWE is a hierarchy of weakness descriptions. The lowest level in the hierarchy is a \"Weakness Base\", which describes a granular weakness. Above Weakness Bases, are Weakness Classes and Categories. In general, rules are linked to Weakness Bases or Classes. </p>\n<p>Tools which meet certain requirements can be certified as <a href=\"http://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/\">CWE Compatible</a>. Those requirements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must be able to search for CWE-related rules using a CWE identifier. To do so in the SonarQube platform, simply drop the CWE identifier (e.g. CWE-595) in the search text input on the rules page and run the search.</li>\n<li>Rules must be accurately linked to their related CWE items. To see the CWE mapping for a SonarQube rule, consult the rule's See section at the bottom of the rule description.</li>\n<li>You must be able to identify the relevant CWE from an Issue. To do so in the SonarQube platform, consult the related rule.</li>\n<li>The product documentation must include a description of CWE and CWE Compatibility.</li>\n<li>The version of CWE supported must be listed. The SonarQube language plugins support version 2.8.</li>\n<li>In addition to searching rules by CWE id's, you can also search by the \"cwe\" rule tag.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To see which CWE items are covered for a language, consult the links below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rules.sonarsource.com/c/tag/cwe\">C</a>/<a href=\"https://rules.sonarsource.com/cpp/tag/cwe\">C++</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/tag/cwe\">Java</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rules.sonarsource.com/objective-c/tag/cwe\">Objective-C</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SANS Top 25</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors/\">SANS Top 25</a> list is a collection of the 25-most dangerous errors listed in the CWE, as compiled by the <a href=\"http://www.sans.org/\">SANS organization</a>. The current SANS list is divided into three categories: Insecure Interaction Between Components, Risky Resource Management, and Porous Defenses.</p>\n<p>The tags used for SANS correspond to its categories: sans-top25-insecure, sans-top25-risky, sans-top25-porous.</p>\n<p>To find rules relating to SANS Top 25, you can perform a text search for the category, or the relevant CWE item, or perform a rule tag search.</p>\n<h3>OWASP Top 10</h3>\n<p>OWASP stands for Open Web Application Security Project.

Typically (but not necessarily) this will be the root project of the Gradle build. Information pertaining to the analysis as a whole has to be configured in the sonarqube block of this project. Any properties set on the command line also apply to this project.</p>\n<pre><code>// build.gradle\nsonarqube {\n    properties {\n        property \"sonar.sourceEncoding\", \"UTF-8\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Configuration shared between subprojects can be configured in a subprojects block.</p>\n<pre><code>// build.gradle\nsubprojects {\n    sonarqube {\n        properties {\n            property \"sonar.sources\", \"src\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Project-specific information is configured in the <code>sonarqube</code> block of the corresponding project.</p>\n<pre><code>// build.gradle\nproject(\":project1\") {\n    sonarqube {\n        properties {\n            property \"sonar.branch\", \"Foo\"\n        }\n    }}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To skip SonarQube analysis for a particular subproject, set sonarqube.skipProject to true.</p>\n<pre><code>// build.gradle\nproject(\":project2\") {\n    sonarqube {\n        skipProject = true\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Task dependencies</h2>\n<p>All tasks that produce output that should be included in the SonarQube analysis need to be executed before the <code>sonarqube</code> task runs. Typically, these are compile tasks, test tasks, and code coverage tasks. To meet these needs, the plugins adds a task dependency from <code>sonarqube</code> on <code>test</code> if the Java plugin is applied. Further task dependencies can be added as needed. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>// build.gradle\nproject.tasks[\"sonarqube\"].dependsOn \"anotherTask\"\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sample project</h2>\n<p>A simple working example is available at this URL so you can check everything is correctly configured in your env:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanning-examples/tree/master/sonarqube-scanner-gradle\">https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanning-examples/tree/master/sonarqube-scanner-gradle</a></p>\n<h2>Analysis property defaults</h2>\n<p>The SonarScanner for Gradle uses information contained in Gradle's object model to provide smart defaults for most of the standard <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/analysis-parameters/\">analysis parameters</a>, as listed below.</p>\n<p>Gradle defaults for standard SonarQube properties: </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Gradle default</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.projectKey</code></td>\n<td><code>[${project.group}:]${project.name}</code> for root module; <code>&#x3C;root module key>:&#x3C;module path></code> for submodules</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.projectName</code></td>\n<td><code>${project.name}</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.projectDescription</code></td>\n<td><code>${project.description}</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.projectVersion</code></td>\n<td><code>${project.version}</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.projectBaseDir</code></td>\n<td><code>${project.projectDir}</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.working.directory</code></td>\n<td><code>${project.buildDir}/sonar</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Notice that additional defaults are provided for projects that have the java-base or java plugin applied:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Gradle default</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.sourceEncoding</code></td>\n<td><code>${project.compileJava.options.encoding}</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.java.source</code></td>\n<td><code>${project.sourceCompatibility}</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.java.target</code></td>\n<td><code>${project.targetCompatibility}</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.sources</code></td>\n<td><code>${sourceSets.main.allSource.srcDirs}</code> (filtered to only include existing directories)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.tests</code></td>\n<td><code>${sourceSets.test.allSource.srcDirs}</code> (filtered to only include existing directories)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.java.binaries</code></td>\n<td><code>${sourceSets.main.output.classesDir}</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.java.libraries</code></td>\n<td><code>${sourceSets.main.compileClasspath}</code> (filtering to only include files; rt.jar and jfxrt.jar added if necessary)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.java.test.binaries</code></td>\n<td><code>${sourceSets.test.output.classesDir}</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.java.test.libraries</code></td>\n<td><code>${sourceSets.test.compileClasspath}</code> (filtering to only include files; rt.jar and jfxrt.jar added if necessary)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.junit.reportPaths</code></td>\n<td><code>${test.testResultsDir}</code> (if the directory exists)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Groovy projects get all the Java defaults, plus:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Gradle default</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.groovy.binaries</code></td>\n<td><code>${sourceSets.main.output.classesDir}</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Additional defaults when JaCoCo plugin is applied</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Gradle default</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.jacoco.reportPaths</code></td>\n<td><code>${jacoco.destinationFile}</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.groovy.jacoco.reportPath</code></td>\n<td><code>${jacoco.destinationFile}</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Additional defaults for Android projects (<code>com.android.application</code>, <code>com.android.library</code>, or <code>com.android.test</code>)\nBy default the first variant of type \"debug\" will be used to configure the analysis.

This can be useful when dealing with sensitive information (e.g. credentials), environment information, or for ad-hoc configuration.</p>\n<pre><code>gradle sonarqube -Dsonar.host.url=http://sonar.mycompany.com -Dsonar.verbose=true\n</code></pre>\n<p>While certainly useful at times, we recommend keeping the bulk of the configuration in a (versioned) build script, readily available to everyone.\nA SonarQube property value set via a system property overrides any value set in a build script (for the same property). When analyzing a project hierarchy, values set via system properties apply to the root project of the analyzed hierarchy. Each system property starting with <code>sonar.</code> will be taken into account.</p>\n<h3>Analyzing Custom Source Sets</h3>\n<p>By default, the SonarScanner for Gradle passes on the project's main source set as production sources, and the project's test source set as test sources. This works regardless of the project's source directory layout. Additional source sets can be added as needed.</p>\n<pre><code>// build.gradle\nsonarqube {\n    properties {\n        properties[\"sonar.sources\"] += sourceSets.custom.allSource.srcDirs\n        properties[\"sonar.tests\"] += sourceSets.integTest.allSource.srcDirs\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Advanced topics</h2>\n<h3>More on configuring SonarQube properties</h3>\n<p>Let's take a closer look at the <code>sonarqube.properties</code> <code>{}</code> block. As we have already seen in the examples, the <code>property()</code> method allows you to set new properties or override existing ones. Furthermore, all properties that have been configured up to this point, including all properties preconfigured by Gradle, are available via the properties accessor.</p>\n<p>Entries in the properties map can be read and written with the usual Groovy syntax. To facilitate their manipulation, values still have their “idiomatic” type (File, List, etc.). After the sonarProperties block has been evaluated, values are converted to Strings as follows: Collection values are (recursively) converted to comma-separated Strings, and all other values are converted by calling their <code>toString()</code> methods.</p>\n<p>Because the <code>sonarProperties</code> block is evaluated lazily, properties of Gradle's object model can be safely referenced from within the block, without having to fear that they have not yet been set.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-gradle/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<div class=\"custom-block alert alert-info\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>By <a href=\"https://www.sonarsource.com/\">SonarSource</a> - GNU LGPL 3 - <a href=\"https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/VSTS\">Issue Tracker</a> - <a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-vsts\">Source</a><br>\nClick <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarqube\">here</a> for the latest version.</p></div></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarqube\">SonarQube</a>  extension for Azure DevOps Server makes it easy to integrate analysis into your build pipeline.

We believe that breaking a CI build is not the right approach. Instead, we are providing pull request decoration (to make sure that issues aren't introduced at merge time) and we'll soon add a way to check the quality gate as part of a Release process.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-azure-devops/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<div class=\"custom-block alert alert-info\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>By <a href=\"https://www.sonarsource.com/\">SonarSource</a> – GNU LGPL 3 – <a href=\"https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/SONARJNKNS\">Issue Tracker</a> – <a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-jenkins\">Source</a><br>\nClick <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonar\">here</a> for the latest version.</p></div></div>\n<p>This plugin lets you centralize the configuration of SonarQube server connection details in Jenkins global configuration.</p>\n<p>Then you can trigger SonarQube analysis from Jenkins using standard Jenkins Build Steps or <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline/\">Jenkins Pipeline DSL</a> to trigger analysis with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/\">SonarScanner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-maven/\">SonarScanner for Maven</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-gradle/\">SonarScanner for Gradle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-msbuild/\">SonarScanner for MSBuild</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the job is complete, the plugin will detect that a SonarQube analysis was made during the build and display a badge and a widget on the job page with a link to the SonarQube dashboard as well as quality gate status.</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonar\">Install the SonarScanner for Jenkins via the Jenkins Update Center</a>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configure your SonarQube server(s):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log into Jenkins as an administrator and go to <strong>Manage Jenkins > Configure System</strong>.</li>\n<li>Scroll down to the SonarQube configuration section, click <strong>Add SonarQube</strong>, and add the values you're prompted for.</li>\n<li>The server authentication token should be created as a 'Secret Text' credential.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Analyzing a .NET solution</h2>\n<p><strong>Global Configuration</strong><br>\nThis step is mandatory if you want to trigger any of your analyses with the SonarScanner for MSBuild.

We recommend installing Visual Studio 2015 update 3 or later on the analysis machine in order to benefit from the integration and features provided with the Visual Studio ecosystem (VSTest, MSTest unit tests, etc.).</p>\n<p>Projects targeting older versions of the .NET Framework can be built using MSBuild 14.0 by setting the \"TargetFrameworkVersion\" MSBuild property as documented by Microsoft:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb398202.aspx\">How to: Target a Version of the .NET Framework</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh264221.aspx\">MSBuild Target Framework and Target Platform</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do not want to switch your production build to MSBuild 14.0, you can set up a separate build dedicated to the SonarQube analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Detection of Test Projects</strong><br>\nSonarQube analyzes test projects differently from non-test projects, so it is important to correctly classify test projects.</p>\n<p>By default, the SonarQube Scanner for MSBuild will detect as test project:</p>\n<p>. MSTest unit test projects, thanks to the presence of a well-known project type GUID in .csproj file of such projects.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Projects with names ending in \"Test\" or \"Tests\". This behavior can be changed by providing the parameter <code>sonar.msbuild.testProjectPattern</code> to the begin step (regex follows .NET Regular Expression in a case-sensitive way with the default value <code>.*Tests?\\.(cs|vb)proj$</code>). This regex is applied against the fullname of the <code>.csproj</code> or <code>.vbproj</code> which is why it's recommended to keep at the end of your custom regex <code>\\.(cs|vb)proj$</code>.\nTo manually classify a project as a test project, mark it with <code>&#x3C;SonarQubeTestProject>true&#x3C;/SonarQubeTestProject></code>:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!-- in .csproj -->\n&#x3C;PropertyGroup>\n&#x3C;!-- Mark the project as being a test project -->\n&#x3C;SonarQubeTestProject>true&#x3C;/SonarQubeTestProject>\n&#x3C;/PropertyGroup>\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Per-project analysis parameters</strong>\nSome analysis parameters can be set for a single MSBuild project by adding them to its .csproj file.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!-- in .csproj -->\n&#x3C;ItemGroup>\n  &#x3C;SonarQubeSetting Include=\"sonar.stylecop.projectFilePath\">\n    &#x3C;Value>$(MSBuildProjectFullPath)&#x3C;/Value>\n  &#x3C;/SonarQubeSetting>\n&#x3C;/ItemGroup>\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Concurrent Analyses on the Same Build Machine</strong><br>\nConcurrent analyses (i.e. parallel analysis of two solutions on the same build machine using a unique service account) are not supported by default by the Scanner for MSBuild. You can enable it as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Locate the folder containing the Scanner for MSBuild</li>\n<li>Go in the <code>Targets</code> folder and copy the folder <code>SonarQube.Integration.ImportBefore.targets</code></li>\n<li>\n<p>Paste it under your build tool global <code>ImportBefore</code> folder (if the folder doesn't exist, create it).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For MSBuild, the path is <code>&#x3C;MSBUILD_INSTALL_DIR>\\&#x3C;Version>\\Microsoft.Common.targets\\ImportBefore</code> where &#x3C;MSBUILD<em>INSTALL</em>DIR> is:\n*For v14, default path is: <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\14.0\\Microsoft.Common.Targets\\ImportBefore</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For v15, default path is: <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Community\\MSBuild\\15.0\\Microsoft.Common.targets\\ImportBefore</code> (for VS Community Edition)</li>\n<li>For v16, default path is: <code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Current\\Microsoft.Common.targets</code> (for VS Community Edition)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For dotnet, the path is <code>&#x3C;DOTNET_SDK_INSTALL_DIR>\\15.0\\Microsoft.Common.targets\\ImportBefore</code> where <code>&#x3C;DOTNET_SDK_INSTALL_DIR></code> can be found using the <code>dotnet --info</code> and looking for the Base Path property.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The performance impact of this global installation for projects that aren't analyzed is negligible as this target is only a bootstrapper and will bail out nearly instantaneously when the <code>.sonarqube</code> folder is not found under the folder being built.</p>\n<p><strong>Using SonarScanner for MSBuild with a Proxy</strong><br>\nOn build machines that connect to the Internet through a proxy server you might experience difficulties connecting to SonarQube. To instruct the Java VM to use the system proxy settings, you need to set the following environment variable before running the SonarScanner for MSBuild:</p>\n<pre><code>SONAR_SCANNER_OPTS = \"-Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>To instruct the Java VM to use specific proxy settings or when there is no system-wide configuration use the following value:</p>\n<pre><code>SONAR_SCANNER_OPTS = \"-Dhttp.proxyHost=yourProxyHost -Dhttp.proxyPort=yourProxyPort\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where <em>yourProxyHost</em> and <em>yourProxyPort</em> are the hostname and the port of your proxy server. There are additional proxy settings for https, authentication and exclusions that could be passed to the Java VM.

It gathers all the configuration required for correct analysis of C/C++/Objective-C projects (such as macro definitions, include directories, …) directly from your project's build process. The Build Wrapper does not impact your build; it merely eavesdrops on it and writes what it learns into files a directory you specify. </p>\n<p>You can download the <em>Build Wrapper</em> directly from your SonarQube server, so that its version perfectly matches your version of the plugin. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download <em>Build Wrapper</em> for Linux from <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube#/static/cpp/build-wrapper-linux-x86.zip\">{SonarQube URL}/static/cpp/build-wrapper-linux-x86.zip</a></li>\n<li>Download <em>Build Wrapper</em> for macOS from <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube#/static/cpp/build-wrapper-macosx-x86.zip\">{SonarQube URL}/static/cpp/build-wrapper-macosx-x86.zip</a></li>\n<li>Download <em>Build Wrapper</em> for Windows from <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube#/static/cpp/build-wrapper-win-x86.zip\">{SonarQube URL}/static/cpp/build-wrapper-win-x86.zip</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unzip the downloaded <em>Build Wrapper</em> and configure it in your <code>PATH</code> because doing so is just more convenient.</p>\n<h3>SonarQube Scanner</h3>\n<p>Analysis of C/C++/Objective-C projects requires the <a href=\"https://redirect.sonarsource.com/doc/install-configure-scanner.html\"><em>SonarScanner</em></a> CLI.</p>\n<h2>Analysis Steps</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you use macOS or Linux operating systems make sure your source tree is in a directory called <code>src</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add execution of the <em>Build Wrapper</em> as a prefix to your usual build command (the examples below use <code>make</code>, <code>xcodebuild</code> and <code>MSBuild</code>, but any build tool that performs a full build can be used)</p>\n<pre><code>// example for linux\nbuild-wrapper-linux-x86-64 --out-dir build_wrapper_output_directory make clean all \n// example for macOS\nbuild-wrapper-macosx-x86 --out-dir build_wrapper_output_directory xcodebuild clean build\n// example for Windows\nbuild-wrapper-win-x86-64.exe --out-dir  build_wrapper_output_directory MSBuild.exe /t:Rebuild\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the <em>sonar-project.properties</em> file at the root of your project add the property <code>sonar.cfamily.build-wrapper-output</code> with the path to the <em>Build Wrapper</em> output directory relative to the project directory (<code>build_wrapper_output_directory</code> in these examples). </p>\n<p>Sample <em>sonar-project.properties</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>sonar.projectKey=myFirstProject\nsonar.projectName=My First C++ Project\nsonar.projectVersion=1.0\nsonar.sources=src\nsonar.cfamily.build-wrapper-output=build_wrapper_output_directory\nsonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Execute the SonarScanner (<code>sonar-scanner</code>) from the root directory of the project</p>\n<pre><code>sonar-scanner\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Follow the link provided at the end of the analysis to browse your project's quality metrics in the UI</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Multithreaded Code Scan</h2>\n<p>It is possible to use all the cores available on the machine running the code scan. This can be activated by configuring the property <code>sonar.cfamily.threads</code> at the scanner level. Its default value is 1.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This feature must not be activated on a machine with only 1 core.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The analyzer will not guess which value is most suitable for your project. It's up to you to test and find the best value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a build machine with 2 cores is already configured to potentially run two code scans at the same time, there is no guarantee that configuring <code>sonar.cfamily.threads=2</code> will bring the expected performance benefits. It can even be worse than running with the default value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The multithreaded execution requires more memory than single-threaded execution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A machine with 64 cores configured with <code>sonar.cfamily.threads=64</code> is not certain to bring a large performance gain compared to a machine with 32 cores. The performance tradeoff will vary depending on the machine, project and setup, so some testing will be required to decide if the performance gain justifies moving to a larger machine.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Solution with a Mix of C# and C++</h2>\n<p>When you have a Solution made of C++ and C#, to both use the SonarQube <em>Build Wrapper</em> and have an accurate analysis of the C# code, you must to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-msbuild\">SonarScanner for MSBuild</a>.\nNote that in this scenario source code stored in shared folders, not considered as a \"Project\" by Visual Studio, won't be scanned.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download and install both the <a href=\"https://redirect.sonarsource.com/doc/install-configure-scanner-msbuild.html\">SonarScanner for MSBuild</a> and the SonarQube <em>Build Wrapper</em> (see <em>Prerequisites</em> section).</li>\n<li>Execute the SonarQube Scanner for MSBuild <code>begin</code> step</li>\n<li>Add execution of <em>Build Wrapper</em> to your normal MSBuild build command</li>\n<li>Execute the SonarQube Scanner for MSBuild <code>end</code> step to complete the analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code>SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe begin /k:\"cs-and-cpp-project-key\" /n:\"My C# and C++ project\" /v:\"1.0\" /d:sonar.cfamily.build-wrapper-output=\"bw_output\"\nbuild-wrapper-win-x86-64.exe --out-dir bw_output MSBuild.exe /t:Rebuild\nSonarScanner.MSBuild.exe end\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Measures for Header Files</h2>\n<p>Each time we analyze a header file as part of a compilation unit, we compute for this header the measures: statements, functions, classes, cyclomatic complexity and cognitive complexity. That means that each measure may be computed more than once for a given header. In that case, we store the largest value for each measure.</p>\n<h2>Building with Bazel</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bazel.build/\">Bazel</a> recommends that you use the <a href=\"https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-user-manual.html#flag--batch\"><code>--batch</code></a> option when running in a Continuous Build context. When using the <em>BuildWrapper</em>, you are in such context. Also, you need to deactivate the <a href=\"https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/bazel-user-manual.html#sandboxing\">\"sandbox\"</a> mechanism of <em>Bazel</em> so that the compiled file paths could be retrieved after the compilation phase.\nHere is an example of the <em>BuildWrapper</em> command with Bazel parameters on macOS:</p>\n<pre><code>build-wrapper-macosx-x86 --out-dir bw bazel\n  --batch\n  --spawn_strategy=standalone\n  --genrule_strategy=standalone\n  --bazelrc=/dev/null build\n  //main:hello-world\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/coverage/\">Test Coverage &#x26; Execution</a> (CPPUnit, GCOV, llvm-cov, Visual Studio, Bullseye)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanning-examples/tree/master/sonarqube-scanner-build-wrapper-linux\">Sample project</a> for C/C++ (Linux)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanning-examples/tree/master/objc-llvm-coverage\">Sample project</a> for Objective-C</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.sonarsource.com/doc/install-configure-scanner-tfs-ts.html\">SonarScanner for Azure Devops</a> (analyzing Visual C++ project)</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/analysis/languages/cfamily/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><em>Apex analysis is available as part of the <a href=\"https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/enterprise.html\">Enterprise Edition</a> and <a href=\"https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/editions.html\">above</a>.</em></p>\n<!-- update_center:sonarapex -->\n<h2>Language-Specific Properties</h2>\n<p>Discover and update the Apex-specific <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/analysis-parameters/\">properties</a> in: <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings?category=apex\"><strong>Administration > General Settings > Apex</strong></a></p>\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/external-issues/\">Importing External Issues</a> (PMD Apex)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/coverage/\">Test Coverage &#x26; Execution</a> (For Salesforce DX project)</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/analysis/languages/apex/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<!-- update_center:csharp -->\n<h2>Language-Specific Properties</h2>\n<p>Discover and update the C#-specific <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/analysis-parameters/\">properties</a> in:  <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings?category=c%23\">Administration > General Settings > C#</a></strong>.</p>\n<h3>Analyze Generated Code</h3>\n<p>To analyze tool-generated code (e.g. WCF code generated by <code>SvcUtil.exe</code>, protobuf code generated by <code>protoc</code>, Swagger client code generated by <code>NSwag</code>) for a specific C# project, enable the \"Analyze generated code\" setting inside <strong>Project > Administration > General Settings > C#</strong>.

The size of the source code area is not limited.</p>\n<p>Variable format is also supported: it's similar to the fixed format but without Area #3.</p>\n<h3>Defining COBOL Dialect</h3>\n<p>Go to <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings?category=cobol\">Administration > General Settings > Cobol</a></strong> and set the \"Dialect\" property.</p>\n<p>The COBOL analyzer supports the following dialects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>bull-gcos-cobol</code></li>\n<li><code>hp-tandem-cobol</code></li>\n<li><code>ibm-os/vs-cobol</code></li>\n<li><code>ibm-ile-cobol</code></li>\n<li><code>ibm-cobol/ii</code></li>\n<li><code>ibm-cobol/400</code></li>\n<li><code>ibm-enterprise-cobol</code></li>\n<li><code>microfocus-cobol</code></li>\n<li><code>microfocus-acucobol-gt-cobol</code></li>\n<li><code>opencobol/cobol-it</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Making Copybooks Available to the Analysis</h3>\n<p>Copybooks are, by definition, COBOL files that are not syntactically valid by themselves. However, copybooks are usually needed to properly parse COBOL programs. Thus, paths to the copybooks must be listed through the <code>sonar.cobol.copy.directories</code> property.</p>\n<h3>Raising Issues Against Copybooks</h3>\n<p>To have copybooks imported into a project, and issues logged against them, the copybook directories must be added to <code>sonar.sources</code> AND the copybook file suffixes must be added to <code>sonar.cobol.file.suffixes</code>. E.G.:</p>\n<pre><code>sonar.sources=cobol,copy1,commonCopy\nsonar.cobol.file.suffixes=cbl,cpy\nsonar.cobol.copy.suffixes=cpy\nsonar.cobol.copy.directories=copy1,commonCopy\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the case where a number of projects share a common set of copybooks, it may not be desirable to increment each project’s technical debt with the issues from the common copybooks. In such cases, the directory holding the common copybooks should be listed in <code>sonar.cobol.copy.directories</code> (as before) but left out of sonar.sources, E.G.:</p>\n<pre><code>sonar.sources=cobol,copy1\nsonar.cobol.file.suffixes=cbl,cpy\nsonar.cobol.copy.suffixes=cpy\nsonar.cobol.copy.directories=copy1,commonCopy\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Analyzing without file suffixes</h3>\n<p>Note that it is possible to analyze a COBOL project without file suffixes. To do this, remove the two suffix-related properties from your configuration and substitute the following setting for <code>sonar.lang.patterns.cobol</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>sonar.lang.patterns.cobol=**/*\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Switching Off Issues</h3>\n<p>There are three ways to switch off issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flagging issues as <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/user-guide/issues/\">false positive</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/project-administration/narrowing-the-focus/\">Ignoring the issues</a></li>\n<li>Using the <code>NOSONAR</code> tag. To switch off an issue, place the <code>NOSONAR</code> tag in a comment line located right before the line containing the issue. Example:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>* NOSONAR, in such case call to GO TO is tolerated, blabla...\n GO TO MY_PARAGRAPH.\n</code></pre>\n<h3>ACUCOBOL-GT Source Code Control Directives</h3>\n<p>The COBOL analyzer supports the ACUCOBOL-GT’s Source Code Control directives. This mechanism allows you to conditionally modify the program at compile time by excluding or including lines. This can be used to maintain different versions of the program, perhaps to support different machine environments.</p>\n<p>The <code>-Si</code> (include) flag controls the actions of the source code control system. It must be followed by an argument that specifies a pattern that the compiler will search for in the Identification Area of each source line. If the pattern is found, then the line will be included in the source program, even if it is a comment line. However, if the pattern is immediately preceded by an exclamation point, then the line will be excluded from the source (i.e., commented out).</p>\n<p>The <code>-Sx</code> (exclude) flag works the same way except that its meaning is reversed (lines with the pattern will be commented out and lines with a preceding exclamation point will be included).</p>\n<p>For example, suppose a program is being maintained for both the UNIX and VMS environments. The following piece of code is in the program:</p>\n<pre><code>MOVE \"SYS$HELP:HELPFILE\" TO FILE-NAME.  VMS\n*MOVE \"/etc/helpfile\" TO FILE-NAME.     UNX\nOPEN INPUT HELP-FILE.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This program fragment is ready to be compiled for the VMS system. If a UNIX version is desired, then the following flags will correct the source during compilation:</p>\n<pre><code>-Si UNX -Sx VMS\n</code></pre>\n<p>Please consult the ACUCOBOL-GT documentation for more on the mechanism.</p>\n<p>There are two ways in SonarQube to specify the list of ACUCOBOL-GT flags to be used in order to preprocess the source code. The first option is to define a list of global flags which will be used to preprocess all source files. This can be done in the <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings?category=cobol\">Administration > General Settings > Cobol</a> > Preprocessor</strong>.</p>\n<p>The second option is to provide a list of relative paths (with help of the ‘sonar.cobol.acucobol.preprocessor.directives.directories’ property) which contain the list of flags to be used for each COBOL source file. Let’s take a simple example. If a file ‘MY<em>PROGRAM.CBL’ is going to be processed, the SonarQube ACUCOBOL-GT preprocessor, will try to find a file ‘MY</em>PROGRAM.CMD’. If this file is found, then the flags contained in this file is going to be used to preprocess the program ‘MY<em>PROGRAM.CBL’. If the file ‘MY</em>PROGRAM.CMD’ doesn’t exist, then the preprocess will use the content of the file ‘DEFAULT.CMD’ if exists.</p>\n<h3>Microfocus Compiler Constants</h3>\n<p>If your code takes advantage of conditional compilation features provided by Microfocus, you may have to configure compiler constants for your analysis. You can define a compiler constant by setting a property named s<code>onar.cobol.compilationConstant.[constant name here].</code></p>\n<p>For example, if your COBOL code looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n      $IF myconstant DEFINED\n       PROGRAM-ID. x.\n      $END\n      $IF otherconstant DEFINED\n       PROGRAM-ID. y.\n      $END\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can set the value of a compiler constant named \"myconstant\" by inserting the following line in your sonar-project.properties file:</p>\n<pre><code>sonar.cobol.compilationConstant.myconstant=myvalue\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Database Catalog (DB2)</h2>\n<p>The COBOL analyzer offers rules which target embedded SQL statements and require the analyzer to have knowledge of the database catalog (E.G. the primary key column(s) of a given table).\nThese rules will raise issues only if the database catalog is provided to the analysis. For the moment, this is available only for IBM DB2 (z/OS) catalogs, and the catalog must be provided via a set of CSV (\"Comma Separated Values\") files.</p>\n<p>These rules rely on two analysis properties:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.cobol.sql.catalog.csv.path</code></td>\n<td>relative path of the directory containing CSV files for the database catalog</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.cobol.sql.catalog.defaultSchema</code></td>\n<td>comma-separated list of default database schemas used in embedded SQL statements</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><code>sonar.cobol.sql.catalog.csv.path</code> should define a directory which contains 8 CSV files. Each of these CSV files contains data for a specific DB2 catalog table and is named after it. The following table lists the required files and their respective mandatory columns. Additional columns may be listed, but will be ignored:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Table</th>\n<th>File name</th>\n<th>Required Columns</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SYSIBM.SYSCOLUMNS</code></td>\n<td><code>SYSCOLUMNS.csv</code></td>\n<td><code>TBNAME</code>,<code>TBCREATOR</code>,<code>NAME</code>,<code>PARTKEY_COLSEQ</code>,<code>DEFAULT</code>,<code>NULLS</code>,<code>DEFAULTVALUE</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES</code></td>\n<td><code>SYSINDEXES.csv</code></td>\n<td><code>NAME</code>,<code>CREATOR</code>,<code>TBNAME</code>,<code>TBCREATOR</code>,<code>UNIQUERULE</code>,<code>INDEXTYPE</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SYSIBM.SYSINDEXPART</code></td>\n<td><code>SYSINDEXPART.csv</code></td>\n<td><code>IXNAME</code>,<code>IXCREATOR</code>,<code>PARTITION</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SYSIBM.SYSKEYS</code></td>\n<td><code>SYSKEYS.csv</code></td>\n<td><code>IXNAME</code>,<code>IXCREATOR</code>,<code>COLNAME</code>,<code>COLSEQ</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SYSIBM.SYSSYNONYMS</code></td>\n<td><code>SYSSYNONYMS.csv</code></td>\n<td><code>NAME</code>,<code>CREATOR</code>,<code>TBNAME</code>,<code>TBCREATOR</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SYSIBM.SYSTABLES</code></td>\n<td><code>SYSTABLES.csv</code></td>\n<td><code>NAME</code>,<code>CREATOR</code>,<code>TYPE</code>,<code>PARTKEYCOLNUM</code>,<code>TSNAME</code>,<code>DBNAME</code>,<code>TBNAME</code>,<code>TBCREATOR</code>,<code>CARDF</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE</code></td>\n<td><code>SYSTABLESPACE.csv</code></td>\n<td><code>NAME</code>,<code>DBNAME</code>,<code>PARTITIONS</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>SYSIBM.SYSVIEWS</code></td>\n<td><code>SYSVIEWS.csv</code></td>\n<td><code>NAME</code>,<code>CREATOR</code>,<code>STATEMENT</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The CSV format is the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each file must be named for the table it represents.</li>\n<li>First line must contain the exact names of the columns.</li>\n<li>Order of the columns is not meaningful.</li>\n<li>Fields are comma-delimited.</li>\n<li>If a field contains a comma, then its value must be surrounded by double quotes (\").</li>\n<li>If a field which is surrounded by double quotes contains a double quote character (\"), then this character must be doubled (\"\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example for <code>SYSVIEWS.csv</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>CREATOR,NAME,STATEMENT\nUSER1,VIEW1,select x from table1\nUSER1,VIEW2,\"select x, y from table1\"\nUSER1,VIEW3,\"select x, \"\"y\"\" from table1\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>UNLOAD</code> DB2 utility with the <code>DELIMITED</code> option should produce the required files except for the column names on the first line.</p>\n<h2>Custom Rules</h2>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>The COBOL analyzer parses the source code, creates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then walks through the entire tree. A coding rule can subscribe to be notified every time a node of a certain type is visited.</p>\n<p>As soon as the coding rule is notified, it can navigate the tree around the node and raise issues if necessary.</p>\n<h3>Writing a Plugin</h3>\n<p>Writing new COBOL coding rules is a six-step process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a standard SonarQube plugin.</li>\n<li>Attach this plugin to the SonarQube COBOL plugin (see the <code>pom.xml</code> file of the provided sample plugin project).</li>\n<li>Create as many custom COBOL coding rules as required by extending <code>com.sonarsource.api.ast.CobolCheck</code> and add them to the previous repository.</li>\n<li>Generate the SonarQube plugin (jar file).</li>\n<li>Place this jar file in the <code>$SONARQUBE_HOME/extensions/plugins</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Restart the SonarQube server.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Plugin Project Sample</h3>\n<p>To get started, clone the sample plugin project and follow the steps below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install Maven</li>\n<li>Build the plugin by running <code>mvn install</code> from the project directory. This will generate a SonarQube plugin jar file in the target directory.</li>\n<li>Add your newly created jar into the <code>$SONARQUBE_HOME/extensions/plugins</code> directory</li>\n<li>Restart the SonarQube server</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you now look at the COBOL quality profiles, you will find the new coding rule (“Sample check”). Don’t forget to activate it. Run an analysis of a COBOL project, and you will find that an issue was logged at line 5 on every file.</p>\n<h3>Subscribing to a NodeType</h3>\n<p>Very often when writing a coding rule, you will want to subscribe to a NodeType. A NodeType can be either a rule of the grammar or a keyword of the language. As an example, here is the code of the implementation of the “Avoid using Merge statement” coding rule:</p>\n<pre><code>public class MergeStatementUsageCheck extends CobolCheck {\n\n  public void init() {\n    subscribeTo(getCobolGrammar().mergeStatement);\n  }\n\n  public void visitNode(AstNode node) {\n    reportIssue(\"Avoid using MERGE statement.\").on(node);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that CICS and SQL grammars can be accessed using <code>getCicsGrammar()</code> and <code>getSqlGrammar()</code>.</p>\n<h3>Coding Rule Lifecycle</h3>\n<p>A coding rule can optionally override six methods inherited from the CobolCheck class. Those methods are called sequentially in the following order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>public void init() {…}</code>: This method is called only once and should be used to subscribe to one or more NodeType(s).</li>\n<li><code>public void visitFile(AstNode astNode) {…}</code>: This method is called on each file before starting the parsing.</li>\n<li><code>public void visitNode(AstNode astNode) {…}</code>: This method is called when an AstNode matches a subscribed NodeType (see Subscribing to a NodeType) and before analyzing its content.</li>\n<li><code>public void leaveNode(AstNode astNode) {…}</code>: This method is called when an AstNode matches a desired NodeType (see Subscribing to a NodeType) and after analyzing its content.</li>\n<li><code>public void leaveFile(AstNode astNode) {…}</code>: This method is called before exiting a file.</li>\n<li><code>public void destroy() {…}</code>: This method is called before shutting down the coding rule.</li>\n<li>The <code>reportIssue(…)</code> method, used to log an issue, should be called only inside the <code>visitFile(…)</code>, <code>visitNode(…)</code>, <code>leaveNode(…)</code> and <code>leaveFile(…)</code> methods. Indeed, the file context isn’t known when the <code>init()</code> and <code>destroy()</code> methods are called, so the issue can’t be associated to a file.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More advanced features are documented in the <a href=\"http://javadocs.sonarsource.org/cobol/apidocs/\">API Javadoc</a>.</p>\n<h3>Navigating the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) with the SSLR COBOL Toolkit</h3>\n<p>When starting to write a new COBOL coding rule, the main difficulty is to understand the COBOL AST in order to know which NodeType(s) need to be visited. This can be achieved by using the <a href=\"https://binaries.sonarsource.com/CommercialDistribution/sslr-cobol-toolkit/\">SSLR COBOL Toolkit</a>, a Swing application that enables loading a COBOL file and displaying its representation as an Abstract Syntax Tree.</p>\n<p>Each node in the AST is a COBOL grammar rule and each leaf in the AST is a COBOL token. Let’s say you want to visit the node <code>ifStatement</code>. In this case, the <code>init()</code> method of your COBOL coding rule must contain the following statement: <code>subscribeTo(getCobolGrammar().ifStatement);</code></p>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<p><em>Since 4.0</em>\nA new API is available to write the rules but also to implement the tests.</p>\n<p>Custom rules should now extend <code>CobolCheck</code> (<code>CobolAstCheck</code> is deprecated) and issues should be logged using the <code>reportIssue(...)</code> method.<br>\nTests on custom rules should now use <code>CobolCheckVerifier</code>: the assertions about issues should now be added as comments inside COBOL test files.<br>\nCustom rules should be listed in an implementation of <code>CobolCheckRepository</code> (<code>CobolAstCheckRepository</code> is now deprecated) and metadata should be loaded by implementing <code>RulesDefinitionExtension</code>.<br>\nYou can now store your custom rules into a dedicated rule repository by implementing SonarQube's <code>RulesDefinition</code>: in that case, you don't need to implement <code>RulesDefinitionExtension</code>.<br>\n<img src=\"/images/exclamation.svg\"> For users who already have custom rules in production: existing issues will be closed and re-opened because the internal keys of the rules are changing.\nIf you wrote a custom plugin against SonarCOBOL 3.x, it should still be compatible at runtime with SonarCOBOL 4.0.</p>\n<p>To migrate to the new API (<a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-custom-rules-examples/pull/14\">full example on github</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, migrate tests without modifying rule classes. That mainly requires moving assertions from java test classes to comments inside test cobol files (<a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-custom-rules-examples/commit/c95b6a84b6fd1efc832a46cd5e1101ee51e6268e\">see an example on github</a>).</li>\n<li>Update check classes to replace the calls to deprecated methods with the new methods which create issues (<a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-custom-rules-examples/commit/d6f6ef7457d99e31990fa64b5ff9cc566775af96\">see an example on github</a>).</li>\n<li>Implement <code>CobolRulesDefinitionExtension</code> and <code>CobolCheckRepository</code>, remove the class extending <code>CobolAstCheckRepository</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-custom-rules-examples/commit/ea15f07ce79366a08fee5b60e9a93c32a4625918\">see an example on github</a>).</li>\n<li>Update check classes to extend <code>CobolCheck</code> instead of <code>CobolAstCheck</code> to stop using deprecated APIs (<a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-custom-rules-examples/commit/8e1d746900f5411e9700fea04700cd804e45e034\">see an example on github</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To move your custom rules to a dedicated rule repository, see <a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-custom-rules-examples/commit/16ad89c4172c259f15bce56edcd09dd5b489eacd\">an example on github</a>.</p>\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/extend/adding-coding-rules/\">Adding Coding Rules</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/analysis/languages/cobol/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<!-- update_center:cssfamily -->\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>In order to analyze CSS code, you need to have Node.js >= 8 installed on the machine running the scan.

This feature allows the deactivation of rules that target higher versions of Java than the one in use in the project so that false positives aren't generated from irrelevant rules.</p>\n<p>The feature relies entirely on the <code>sonar.java.source</code> property, which is automatically filled by most of the scanners used for analyses (Maven, Gradle). Java version-specific rules are not disabled when <code>sonar.java.source</code> is not provided. Concretely, rules which are designed to target specific java versions (tagged \"java7\" or \"java8\") are activated by default in the Sonar Way Java profile. From a user perspective, the feature is fully automatic, but it means that you probably want your projects to be correctly configured.</p>\n<p>When using SonarScanner to perform analyses of project, the property <code>sonar.java.source</code> can to be set manually in <code>sonar-project.properties</code>. Accepted formats are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"1.X\" (for instance 1.6 for java 6, 1.7 for java 7, 1.8 for java 8, etc.)</li>\n<li>\"X\" (for instance 7 for java 7, 8 for java 8, etc. )</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: <code>sonar.java.source=1.6</code></p>\n<p>If the property is provided, the analysis will take the source version into account, and execute related rules accordingly. At run time, each of these rules will be executed – or not – depending of the Java version used by sources within the project.

It should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extend <code>DoubleDispatchVisitorCheck</code> or <code>SubscriptionVisitorCheck</code></li>\n<li>Define the rule name, key, tags, etc. with Java annotations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Declare this class in the <code>RulesDefinition</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Implementation Details</h3>\n<h4>Using DoubleDispatchVisitorCheck</h4>\n<p><code>DoubleDispatchVisitorCheck</code> extends <code>DoubleDispatchVisitor</code> which provide a set of methods to visit specific tree nodes (these methods' names start with <code>visit</code>). To explore a part of the AST, override the required method(s). For example, if you want to explore <code>if</code> statement nodes, override the <code>DoubleDispatchVisitor#visitIfStatement</code> method that will be called each time an <code>IfStatementTree</code> node is encountered in the AST.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block alert alert-warning\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>When overriding a visit method, you must call the <code>super</code> method in order to allow the visitor to visit the rest of the tree.</p></div></div>\n<h4>Using SubscriptionVisitorCheck</h4>\n<p><code>SubscriptionVisitorCheck</code> extends <code>SubscriptionVisitor</code>. To explore a part of the AST, override <code>SubscribtionVisitor#nodesToVisit()</code> by returning the list of the <code>Tree#Kind</code> of node you want to visit. For example, if you want to explore <code>if</code> statement nodes the method will return a list containing the element <code>Tree#Kind#IF_STATEMENT</code>.</p>\n<h4>Create issues</h4>\n<p>Use these methods to log an issue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>JavaScriptCheck#addIssue(tree, message)</code> creates and returns an instance of <code>PreciseIssue</code>. In the SonarQube UI this issue will highlight all code corresponding to the tree passed as the first parameter. To add cost (effort to fix) or secondary locations provide these values to your just-created instance of <code>PreciseIssue</code>.</li>\n<li><code>JavaScriptCheck#addIssue(issue)</code> creates and returns the instance of <code>Issue</code>. Use this method to create non-standard issues (e.g. for a file-level issue instantiate <code>FileIssue</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Check context</h4>\n<p>Check context is provided by <code>DoubleDispatchVisitorCheck</code> or <code>SubscriptionVisitorCheck</code> by calling the <code>JavaScriptCheck#getContext</code> method. Check context provides you access to the root tree of the file, the file itself and the symbol model (information about variables).</p>\n<h4>Test rule</h4>\n<p>To test the rule you can use <code>JavaScriptCheckVerifier#verify()</code> or <code>JavaScriptCheckVerifier#issues()</code>. To be able to use these methods add a dependency to your project:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;dependency>\n  &#x3C;groupId>org.sonarsource.javascript&#x3C;/groupId>\n  &#x3C;artifactId>javascript-checks-testkit&#x3C;/artifactId>\n  &#x3C;version>XXX&#x3C;/version>\n  &#x3C;scope>test&#x3C;/scope>\n&#x3C;/dependency>\n</code></pre>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<h4>SonarJS 4.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>CustomJavaScriptRulesDefinition</code> is deprecated. Implement extension <code>RulesDefinition</code> and <code>CustomRuleRepository</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>SonarJS 4.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Method <code>TreeVisitorContext#getFile()</code> is removed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Related Pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/analysis/coverage/\">Test Coverage &#x26; Execution</a> (LCOV format)</li>\n<li><a

It is up to the\nadministrators to make sure each member gets the relevant permissions.</p>\n<p>To avoid having to manage individual permissions at a project level, organization admins can create groups to manage permissions\nand add new users to those groups on the \"Members\" page.</p>\n<h2>Future evolutions</h2>\n<p>Future versions of SonarCloud will make this onboarding process easier for BitBucket Cloud, Azure Devops, and others.\nUsers' permissions will be retrieved from systems and mapped to SonarCloud permissions on a best-effort basis.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/sonarcloud/organizations/manage-team/"}}},{"node":{"html":"<h2>Free plan organization</h2>\n<p>Free plan organizations are public.

Assume you have a set of projects which has been split for technical reasons, but which shares a lifecycle; they interact directly in production and are always released together. With an Application, they can be treated as a single entity in SonarQube with a unified Project Homepage, Issues list, Measures space, and most importantly: Quality Gate.</p>\n<h3>Applications vs. Portfolios</h3>\n<p>Applications and Portfolios are both aggregations of projects, but they have different goals and therefore different presentations. A Portfolio is designed to be a very high-level, executive overview that shows how a package of projects that may only be tangentially related are doing quality-wise, and what the trends are. Applications allow you to see your set of projects as a larger, overall meta-project. For instance, because all the projects in an application ship together, if one of them isn't releasable then none of them are, and an Application's consolidated Quality Gate gives you an immediate summary of what must be fixed across all projects in order to allow you to release the set.</p>\n<h2>Application Setup</h2>\n<p>Applications are created and edited in the global Portfolio administration interface: <strong>Administration > Configuration > Portfolios</strong>. For more, see <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/project-administration/configuring-portfolios-and-applications/\">Configuring Portfolios and Applications</a>. Applications must be created initially by a user with global administration rights, but after set-up, administration of an individual Application can be delegated to other users.</p>\n<h3>Populating Application Data</h3>\n<p>An Application is automatically re-calculated after each analysis of one of its projects. If you want immediate (re)calculation, a user with administration rights on the Application can use the <strong>Recompute</strong> button in the Application-level <strong>Administration > Edit Definition</strong> interface. The global Portfolio administration interface: <strong>Administration > Configuration > Portfolios</strong> offers the ability to queue re-computation of all Applications and Portfolios at once.</p>\n<h2>Applications and Branch Analysis</h2>\n<p>Branches are available for Applications. They allow you to aggregate branches from the projects in an Application.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Avoid adding branches to your application that will be deleted to prevent issues with your Application status.</p>\n<p>Once an Application has been set up, anyone with administration rights on the Application can manually create a new branch in the <strong>Administration > Edit Definition</strong> interface. Branches can also be managed from the global <strong>Administration > Configuration > Portfolios</strong> interface. For each Application branch you can choose which project branch should be included, or whether the project should be represented in the branch at all.</p>","headings":[{"depth":2,"value":"Using Applications"},{"depth":3,"value":"Applications vs. Portfolios"},{"depth":2,"value":"Application Setup"},{"depth":3,"value":"Populating Application Data"},{"depth":2,"value":"Applications and Branch Analysis"}],"frontmatter":{"title":"Applications"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/user-guide/applications/"}}
