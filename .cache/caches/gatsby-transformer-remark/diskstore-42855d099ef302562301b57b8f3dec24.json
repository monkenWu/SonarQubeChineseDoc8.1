With this focus, your new code will be issue-free and you'll clean up the code you encounter along the way. For more information on the New Code Period, see the <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/user-guide/clean-as-you-code/\">Clean as You Code</a> page.</p>\n<p>You can set a New Code Period at the global, project, or branch level.</p>\n<h2>Setting a global New Code Period</h2>\n<p>Your global New Code Period will be the default for your projects. You can set the global New Code Period at <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings?category=new_code_period/\"><strong>Administration > Configuration > General Settings > New Code Period</strong></a>.  </p>\n<p>You can set the global New Code Period to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Previous Version</strong> – The New Code Period defaults to <strong>Previous version</strong> which shows any changes made in your project's current version. This works well for projects with regular versions or releases.</li>\n<li><strong>Number of days</strong> – You can specify a number of days for a floating New Code Period. For example, setting <strong>Number of Days</strong> to 30 creates a floating New Code Period beginning 30 days from the current date.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting a project-level New Code Period</h2>\n<p>You can override the global New Code Period by setting a project-level New Code Period from the project page at <strong>Administration > New Code Period</strong>.
