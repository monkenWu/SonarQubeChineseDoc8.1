If you're using PR analysis provided by the Developer Edition, issues marked False Positive or Won't Fix will retain that status after merge. This is the preferred approach.</p>\n<p><strong>//NOSONAR</strong><br>\nMost language analyzers support the use of the generic mechanism: <code>//NOSONAR</code> at the end of the line of the issue. This will suppress the all issues - now and in the future - that might be raised on the line.</p>\n<h2>How do I find and remove projects that haven't been analyzed in a while?</h2>\n<p>In <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/projects_management\">Administration > Projects > Management</a></strong> you can search for <strong>Last analysis before</strong> to filter projects not analyzed since a specific date, and then use bulk <strong>Delete</strong> to remove the projects that match your filter.</p>\n<p>This can be automated by using the corresponding Web API: <code>api/projects/bulk_delete?analyzedBefore=YYYY-MM-DD</code>.</p>\n<h2>How do I trigger a full ElasticSearch reindex?</h2>\n<p>Currently, the only way to force a reindex is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop your server</li>\n<li>Remove the contents of the $SQ_HOME/data/es6 directory</li>\n<li>Start your server</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before doing this, you should be aware first that processes are in place on the SonarQube side that out-of-sync indices are detected and corrected, and second that a full re-index can be quite lengthy depending on the size of your instance.</p>\n<h2>Why can't I use my HTTP Proxy since I upgraded to Java8u111?</h2>\n<p>If you are getting this error in the logs when trying to use the Marketplace:</p>\n<pre><code>java.io.IOException: Unable to tunnel through proxy.
