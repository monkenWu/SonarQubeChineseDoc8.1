Your SonarQube cluster is also scalable, and you can add application nodes to increase your computing capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Start, Stop, or Upgrade the Cluster</h2>\n<h3>Start the Cluster</h3>\n<p>To start a cluster, you need to follow these steps in order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start the search nodes</li>\n<li>Start the application nodes</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Stop the Cluster</h3>\n<p>To stop a cluster, you need to follow these steps in order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stop the application nodes</li>\n<li>Stop the search nodes</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Upgrade SonarQube</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Stop the cluster.</li>\n<li>Upgrade SonarQube on all nodes (application part, plugins, JDBC driver if required) following the usual upgrade procedure but without triggering the /setup phase.</li>\n<li>Once all nodes have the same binaries: restart the cluster.</li>\n<li>At this point, only one of the application nodes is up. Try to access <code>node_ip:port/setup</code> on each application node, and trigger the setup operation on the one that responds.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Start or Stop a Node</h2>\n<p>You can start or stop a single node in the same way as starting and stopping an instance using a single server. By default, it's a graceful shutdown where no new analysis report processing can start, but the tasks in progress are allowed to finish.</p>\n<h2>Install or Upgrade a Plugin</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Stop the application nodes.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Install or upgrade the plugin on the application nodes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If upgrading, remove the old version.</li>\n<li>You don't need to install plugins on search nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Restart the application nodes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Scalability</h2>\n<p>You have the option of adding application nodes (up to 10 total application nodes) to your cluster to increase computing capabilities. </p>\n<h3>Adding an Application Node</h3>\n<p>To add an Application Node:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Configure your new application node in sonar.properties. The following is an example of the configuration to be added to sonar.properties for a sixth application node (server6, ip6) in a cluster with the default five servers:</p>\n<p><strong>server6</strong></p>\n<pre><code>...\nsonar.cluster.enabled=true\nsonar.cluster.hosts=ip1,ip2,ip6\nsonar.cluster.search.hosts=ip3,ip4,ip5\nsonar.cluster.node.type=application\nsonar.auth.jwtBase64Hs256Secret=YOURGENERATEDSECRET\n...\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update the configuration of the preexisting nodes to include your new node. </p>\n<p>While you don't need to restart the cluster after adding a node, you should ensure the configuration is up to date on all of your nodes to avoid issues when you eventually do need to restart.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Removing an Application Node</h3>\n<p>When you remove an application node, make sure to update the configuration of the remaining nodes. Much like adding a node, while you don't need to restart the cluster after removing a node, you should ensure the configuration is up to date on all of your nodes to avoid issues when you eventually do need to restart.</p>\n<h2>Monitoring</h2>\n<p>CPU and RAM usage on each node have to be monitored separately with an APM. </p>\n<p>In addition, we provide a Web API <em>api/system/health</em> you can use to validate that all of the nodes in your cluster are operational.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>GREEN: SonarQube is fully operational</li>\n<li>YELLOW: SonarQube is usable, but it needs attention in order to be fully operational</li>\n<li>RED: SonarQube is not operational</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To call it from a monitoring system without having to give admin credentials, it is possible to setup a System Passcode through the property <code>sonar.web.systemPasscode</code>. This must be configured in <em>$SONARQUBE-HOME/conf/sonar.properties</em>.</p>\n<h3>Cluster Status</h3>\n<p>On the System Info page at <strong>Administration > System</strong>, you can check whether your cluster is running safely (green) or has some nodes with problems (orange or red).</p>\n<h3>Maximum Pending Time for Tasks</h3>\n<p>On the global Background Tasks page at <strong>Administration > Projects > Background Tasks</strong>, you can see the number of <strong>pending</strong> tasks as well as the maximum <strong>pending time</strong> for the tasks in the queue. This shows the pending time of the oldest background task waiting to be processed. You can use this to evaluate if it might be worth configuring additional Compute Engine workers (Enterprise Edition) or additional nodes (Data Center Edition) to improve SonarQube performance. </p>\n<h2>Compute Engine Workers</h2>\n<p>If you change the number of <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/instance-administration/compute-engine-performance/\">Compute Engine workers</a> in the UI, you must restart each application node to have the change take effect.</p>\n<h2>Project Move</h2>\n<p>When the <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/instance-administration/project-move/\">Project Move</a> feature is used in a DC installation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects are exported on only one of the application nodes </li>\n<li>The archive of the exported projects must be copied to all the applications nodes in the target server</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Configuration details</h2>\n<p>Start with the <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/setup/install-cluster/\">default configuration</a>; it's good in most cases. The details below are only needed in specific cases.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hazelcast.org/\">Hazelcast</a> is used to manage the communication between the nodes of the cluster. You don't need to install it yourself, it's provided out of the box.</p>\n<p>The following properties may be defined in the <em>$SONARQUBE-HOME/conf/sonar.properties</em> file of each node in a cluster. When defining a property that contains a list of hosts (<code>*.hosts</code>) the port is not required if the default port was not overridden in the configuration.</p>\n<h3>All nodes</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Default</th>\n<th>Required</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.cluster.enabled</code></td>\n<td>Set to <code>true</code> in each node to activate the cluster mode</td>\n<td><code>false</code></td>\n<td>yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>sonar.cluster.name</code></td>\n<td>The name of the cluster. <strong>Required if multiple clusters are present on the same network.</strong> For example this prevents mixing Production and Preproduction clusters.
