Therefore, we typically only accept minor cosmetic changes and typo fixes for SonarQube, but we do happily welcome contributions to the other open source projects under the SonarSource umbrella. </p>\n<h2>General guidelines</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose an open ticket in <a href=\"https://jira.sonarsource.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa\">JIRA</a> or propose your change on the <a href=\"https://community.sonarsource.com\">SonarQube Community Forum</a> - the discussion there is likely to result in an open JIRA ticket. ;-)</li>\n<li>Use the SonarSource conventions, which you'll find neatly packaged here: <a href=\"https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-developer-toolset#the-almost-unbreakable-build\">https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-developer-toolset#the-almost-unbreakable-build</a></li>\n<li>Use pull requests to submit your work</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New rule implementations in existing plugins</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Start from an existing <a href=\"https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/RSPEC-1973?filter=10375\">RSpec</a> (Rule Specification) that lists your language of interest in the \"Targeted languages\" field. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the RSpec you're interested in doesn't target the language where you want to implement it, raise the question on the Community Forums .</li>\n<li>If no RSpec exists for the rule you want to implement, raise the question on the <a href=\"https://community.sonarsource.com/\">Community Forum</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Put your rule implementation class in the [language]-checks (e.g. java-checks, javascript-checks, &#x26;etc.) module, in the checks sub-package</li>\n<li>The naming convention for implementation classes is [A-Z][a-za-z]+Check.java. (Yes, put \"Check\" in the name too.) The class name should be descriptive and not reflect the rule key. E.G. FindBadCodeCheck.java, not S007.java.</li>\n<li>A good way to get started on a rule implementation is to look at the implementations of rules that do similar things.</li>\n<li>During development there's no need to load the plugin in a server to test your implementation, use the rule's unit test for that.</li>\n<li>\n<p>For a complete implementation, make sure all of the following are done:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create HTML description file and metadata file</li>\n<li>write test class</li>\n<li>register the rule in CheckList.java</li>\n<li>add the rule to the profile used for the integration test in <code>profile.xml</code></li>\n<li>run the integration test and add any new issues to the set of expected issues </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>"}
