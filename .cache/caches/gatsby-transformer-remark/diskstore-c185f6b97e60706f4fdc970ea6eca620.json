Then, asynchronously, these notifications are sent via email.</p>\n<p>To set the frequency with which the notification queue is processed, set <code>the sonar.notifications.delay</code> property (in seconds) in <em>$SONARQUBE-HOME/conf/sonar.properties</em>. The server must be restarted for the new value to be taken into account.</p>\n<h2>Who gets notifications</h2>\n<p>Only users who subscribe themselves will get notifications. With only one exception, there is no admin functionality to proactively subscribe another user. If you believe a user should be receiving notifications, then it's time to practice the gentle art of persuasion.</p>\n<h3>The exception</h3>\n<p>Notifications will automatically (without user opt-in) be sent to users with Quality Profile Administration rights when built-in quality profiles are updated. These updates can only happen via an upgrade of the relevant analyzer. This type of notification is on by default, and can be toggled globally in <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings/\">Administration > General Settings > General</a></strong>.</p>\n<h2>Email Configuration</h2>\n<p>To configure the email server, go to <strong><a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/settings\">Administration > General Settings > Email</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>Check also the Server base URL property at Administration > General Settings > General to make sure that links in those notification emails will redirect to the right SonarQube server URL.</p>"}
