It does that by selectively keeping data from previous analyses (see <a href=\"/SonarQubeChineseDoc8.1/instance-administration/housekeeping/\">Housekeeping</a>). It doesn't keep all previous analyses - that would bloat the database. Similarly, for the analyses it does keep, SonarQube doesn't keep all the data. Once a project snapshot moves from the \"Last analysis\" (i.e. the most recent) to being part of the project's history, data below the project level is purged - again to keep from bloating the database.</p>\n<p>Typically these aren't things you need to even think about; SonarQube just handles them for you. But occasionally you may need to remove a bad snapshot from a project's history or change the housekeeping algorithms.</p>\n<h2>Managing History</h2>\n<p>Occasionally, you may need to manually delete a project snapshot, whether because the wrong quality profile was used, or because there was a problem with analysis, and so on. Note that the most recent snapshot (labeled \"Last snapshot\") can never be deleted.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block alert alert-warning\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p><strong>About deleting snapshots</strong><br/><br/>\nDeleting a snapshot is a 2-step process:<br/><br/></p><ul>\n<li>The snapshot must first be removed from the project history by clicking on Delete snapshot.
