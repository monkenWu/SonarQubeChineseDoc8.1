You may want to post an RFF (Request for Feedback) before a release although it is not required. If you do, please close the thread before final release with a \"feedback period closed\" notice.</p>\n<h2>Plugin deprecation</h2>\n<p>Occasionally, there's a need to deprecate a plugin. Typically for one or more of the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the functionality is obsolete or relies on deprecated platform functionality.</li>\n<li>It's no longer maintained by its authors and is buggy.</li>\n<li>It's no longer compatible with supported versions of the SonarQube platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In such case, the plugin is removed from the Marketplace.</p>\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong> What should the release candidate announcement look like?<br>\nThis is up to you, but ideally, it will contain a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>link to download the RC</li>\n<li>link to the version change log </li>\n<li>deadline for feedback</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, you should probably mention the contributors to the version if you didn't handle it solo.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong> How long should the feedback period be?<br>\nAgain, that's up to you; it's your plugin. At SonarSource, when we put out a Release Candidate (we don't always &#x26; its optional for you too), we use a minimum 72 hour feedback period (with variations for holidays, weekends, and significant feedback).</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  Who can give feedback?<br>\nAnyone! In fact, the more feedback the better. That's what makes developing in a community so wonderful. We just ask that when you have feedback, you keep it polite and respectful.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  What if I don't get any feedback on my release candidate?<br>\nYou have two choices: agitate for more attention or consider no news to be good news and proceed with your release.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  What if I get feedback that should block the release?<br>\nThe normal course of action here is to address the feedback and put out another release candidate. Typically, you would extend the feedback period to give people time to test the new version.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  What happens when the feedback period is over?<br>\nIf you didn't get any feedback that you feel should block the release, then send a \"period closed\" notification on the same thread, perform the release, and in a separate thread ask that the new version be added to the Marketplace.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  Should the initial release of a plugin be handled any differently than subsequent releases?<br>\nNot necessarily, although it's probably more critical to get feedback on an initial release. So if there's no response within the initial feedback period, you should probably agitate for more attention, instead of assuming that no news is good news. It's up to you, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  Who performs the release process?<br>\nYou do.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  Where should the jars be posted for download?<br>\nUp to you. If you're using GitHub to host your source code, then the easiest thing to do is create a project release and post downloads there.</p>\n<p><strong>Q.</strong>  What should the release notes look like?<br>\nIn the best case, it will be a publicly accessible list of work tickets handled in the version, similar to what you can get from Jira or GitHub Issues. At minimum, it will be an outline of the work done. In either case, it must reflect all significant changes.</p>"}
