This means that almost everything is visible to any user - even anonymous ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects</li>\n<li>Issues</li>\n<li>Quality Profiles</li>\n<li>Quality Gates</li>\n<li>Rules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following pages are restricted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Members: to members of the organization</li>\n<li>Administration pages: to administrators of the organization</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Paid plan organization</h2>\n<p>Paid plan organizations are private. This means that nothing is visible to non-members of the organization. In other words, you need to be a member of the organization to see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects - which are private by default</li>\n<li>Issues</li>\n<li>Quality Profiles</li>\n<li>Quality Gates</li>\n<li>Rules</li>\n<li>Members</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The administration pages are obviously also restricted to administrators of the organization.</p>\n<h3>Want to make one project public?</h3>\n<p>If you are on a paid plan organization but want to make a project public (for instance because you are developing an open-source library), this is possible. You will have to manually make the project public in its <strong>Administration > Permissions</strong> page. Once done, you will notice the \"Public\" badge on the project.</p>\n<p>As soon as you have one public project, the following pages will become visible to any user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects</li>\n<li>Issues</li>\n<li>Rules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"Quality Profiles\" and \"Quality Gates\" pages will remain restricted to members only - since you might not want to unveil some information used by your private projects.</p>"}
