This renders <code>Last analysis had 1 warning</code> if <code>warningsCount</code> equals 1 and <code>Last analysis had 2 warnings</code> otherwise, in this case 2.</li>\n<li>Learn more about this syntax <a href=\"https://formatjs.io/guides/message-syntax/#plural-format\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"custom-block alert alert-warning\"><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p><strong>UTF-8 encoding</strong><br>\nIn the Java API, properties files are supposed to be encoded in ISO-8859 charset. Without good tooling, it can be quite annoying to write translations for languages that do not fit in this charset.\nThis is why we decided to encode the properties files in UTF-8, and let Maven turn them into ASCII at build time thanks to native2ascii-maven-plugin (check the French plugin pom.xml). This makes the process of writing translations with a standard editor far easier.</p></div></div>\n<h3>How to read localized messages from a plugin extension?</h3>\n<p>The component <code>org.sonar.api.i18n.I18n</code> is available for web server extensions. Scanner extensions cannot load bundles.</p>\n<h2>Writing a Language Pack</h2>\n<p>A Language Pack defines bundles for SonarQube and/or plugins.</p>\n<h3>Creating a Language Pack</h3>\n<p>The easiest way to create a new pack is to copy the <a href=\"https://github.com/SonarQubeCommunity/sonar-l10n-zh\">Chinese Pack</a> and adapt it to your language.</p>\n<h3>Maintaining a Language Pack</h3>\n<p>In the pom file, set the versions of SonarQube and of the plugins you want to translate. When it's time to update your language pack for a new version of SonarQube or a plugin, the easiest way to see what keys are missing is to run:</p>\n<pre><code>mvn test\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the build fails, it means that some keys are missing. Go to <code>target/l10n</code> to check the reports for each bundle. Missing keys are listed under 'Missing translations are:'</p>\n<pre><code>Missing translations are:\ncode_viewer.no_info_displayed_due_to_security=Due to security settings, no information can be displayed.\ncomparison.version.latest=LATEST\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each time you add a new bundle or update an existing one, please create a JIRA ticket on the corresponding L10n component in order to track changes.</p>\n<h2>Localizing a Plugin</h2>\n<p>This section applies if you are developing a closed-source plugin. If your plugin falls in this category, it must embed its own bundles. Bundle must be defined in <code>src/main/resources/org/sonar/l10n/&#x3C;plugin key>_&#x3C;language>.properties</code></p>\n<p>The default bundle is mandatory, and must be English. For example the plugin with key \"mysonarplugin\" must define the following files in order to enable the French translation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>org/sonar/l10n/mysonarplugin.properties</code></li>\n<li><code>org/sonar/l10n/mysonarplugin_fr.properties</code></li>\n</ul>"}
